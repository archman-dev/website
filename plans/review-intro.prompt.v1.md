I want you to review this intro.md and make sure all the "start here" and "choose your path" defined well enough, with good structure. Not redundant but yet not skipping anyting important for different roles or goals.

`What's inside this manual` should be before any other sections but after welcome section.

Go over all the docs, overview.md files, and make sure you didn't miss anything in this intro.md (only if it makes sense to mention)

# Overview Pages

Use this prompt to generate simple, practitioner-friendly overview pages for every topic at the same level as a specific overview page in the Docusaurus docs. Keep it short, useful, and consistent.

---

## When to use this prompt (examples)

- New or reorganized category where sibling topics lack a concise overview (for example, a new "Security" or "Data" section).
- Existing category with mixed depth: some topics have deep content but no quick entry point (latency targets, scalability patterns, ADRs lifecycle).
- Preparation for a navigation refresh: creating consistent overviews improves sidebar scannability and cross-link density.
- Quality pass before a release: normalize tone, structure, and links across all sibling topics in a category.

## When not to use it

- Single doc touch-up that is not an overview (prefer editing the specific page directly).
- One-off content that lives outside sidebars or categories (blog posts, changelogs).
- Pages that intentionally are reference-only (API schemas, autogenerated docs) and don't benefit from narrative overviews.

## Inputs

- OVERVIEW_URL: docs/well-architected/overview
- OPTIONAL: CATEGORY_SLUG if the URL doesn’t resolve locally (e.g., /docs/foundations/).
- OPTIONAL: OUTPUT_DIR override if you’re not writing next to the existing docs.
- OPTIONAL: SCOPE="single"
  - single: edit the single overview page at OVERVIEW_URL. Do not create a new file if one already exists.

## Goal

When SCOPE is "single": find the specific overview page at OVERVIEW_URL and edit its content. Do not create a new folder structure or a new overview file if one already exists at that path.

## Scope control and guardrails

Read SCOPE first and apply these hard rules:

- SCOPE="single":
  - Only edit the file at OVERVIEW_URL. No other paths may change. No file adds, deletes, renames, or moves.
  - Do not modify sidebars, config, or any sibling files/folders. Do not create placeholder pages.
  - If OVERVIEW_URL does not exist, stop and request a correct path or CATEGORY_SLUG. Do not create a new file.
  - Content changes (including frontmatter) are allowed within the single file.

Tip: In single scope, computing sibling names for reference is fine, but do not write or alter them.

## Understanding siblings (what they are and how they help)

- Definition: "Siblings" are files and subfolders that sit next to the current overview within the same directory, excluding `_category_.json` and the overview file itself.
- Why they matter: A consistent overview per sibling gives readers a stable on-ramp into each topic, improves sidebar comprehension, and creates predictable cross-links.
- Typical sibling types:
  - Leaf pages (for example, `nfrs.md`, `principles.md`).
  - Subtopic folders (for example, `identity-security/`, `messaging/`), where the overview introduces the folder and links to key children.
- Good outcomes:
  - Faster navigation: readers scan 3–5 bullets and a diagram to orient.
  - Better cohesion: overviews share structure and tone; links reinforce relationships across topics.
  - Easier maintenance: a small, consistent artifact to update when topics evolve.

## What not to do

- **Do not create a new `overview.md` file inside a new directory.** The `OVERVIEW_URL` points to an existing file that you must edit.
- **Do not create variations of `overview.md`** (e.g., `overview-1.md`, `new-overview.md`).
- **Do not edit or touch any other files** when `SCOPE="single"`. Your task is confined to the single file specified in `OVERVIEW_URL`.
- **Do not change sidebars, config, or routing** (e.g., `sidebars.ts`, `docusaurus.config.ts`) when `SCOPE="single"`.
- **Do not add, remove, rename, or move files** when `SCOPE="single"`, even if a sibling appears incomplete.

## How to find “topics at the same level”

- Use the page’s sidebar and breadcrumbs to identify the category and its siblings.
- Treat files/folders under the same directory as “topics.” Skip _category_.json and the current overview.
- If ambiguity remains, assume the directory of the overview page and list all immediate children (files and subfolders) as topics.

### Practical steps

1. Start from the `OVERVIEW_URL` directory on disk (for example, `docs/foundations/`).
1. List immediate children (files and subfolders). Ignore `_category_.json` and the overview.
1. For each remaining child:

- If it is a Markdown file, it is a topic. Write/update an overview in that file if it already functions as the topic entry; otherwise, keep the file as-is and ensure the overview links to it.
- If it is a folder, the folder is a topic. Ensure the folder has an entry page (commonly `index.md` or `overview.md`). If it lacks one, and SCOPE is "siblings", create a concise `index.md` inside that folder as the overview. If SCOPE is "single", do not create or modify anything in that folder.

1. Cross-check with `sidebars.ts` (if present) to confirm what appears in the UI and adjust links accordingly.

## Execution steps by scope

### Single

1. Verify that OVERVIEW_URL exists. If missing, stop and request the correct path or CATEGORY_SLUG.
1. Edit only the target file’s content to meet the template and acceptance checks.
1. Do not modify any other files. Confirm that the only changed path is OVERVIEW_URL.

### Siblings

1. Discover siblings (files and folders) next to OVERVIEW_URL, excluding the current overview and `_category_.json`.
1. For each sibling topic:

- If file: ensure it has an overview structure; update in place.
- If folder: ensure an entry page exists; create `index.md` only if missing.

1. Keep each page within acceptance checks; add 3–6 relevant internal links.

### Example: foundations siblings

Given `OVERVIEW_URL = docs/foundations/overview.md`, siblings in `docs/foundations/` include:

- `nfrs.md` — Non‑Functional Requirements.
- `quality-attributes.md` — common quality attributes and interactions.
- `principles.md` — guiding constraints for design.
- `adrs.md` — Architecture Decision Records lifecycle and usage.
- `governance.md` — triggers, roles, and paved paths.

Each of these benefits from a brief overview that clarifies when it matters, the core choices, one small diagram, and 3–6 links to the most relevant docs in that topic.

## What to produce

- If SCOPE="single": only the single overview page at OVERVIEW_URL.
- Each page as a Docusaurus Markdown file with:
  - Frontmatter: id, title, description, sidebar_label, tags (optional).
  - No H1 in the body (Docusaurus sets it). Use H2/H3 only.
  - 1 admonition if it adds real value (note/tip/warning).
  - 1 Mermaid diagram (flow or component), max ~12 nodes, with a 1–2 line caption (use italic text under the diagram; no HTML).
  - 3–6 internal links to the most relevant docs in that topic/category, using Markdown links with descriptive text (no bare URLs).
  - Accessibility: short alt text on images (if any), descriptive link text.
  - Abbreviations: expand on first use (e.g., Non‑Functional Requirements (NFRs), Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), Pull Request (PR), PCI DSS, HIPAA). After that, use the abbreviation. Do not use inline HTML tooltips.

### Extra guidance

- Frontmatter `id` should be unique and kebab-case (for example, `adrs-overview`).
- Prefer stable slugs if moving files across folders; otherwise, rely on defaults.
- The diagram should explain the topic’s interaction or lifecycle, not restate the bullets.
- Links should prioritize the top 3–6 canonical docs for the topic, not every page.

## Style

- Voice: smart, experienced, and human. Practical and confident without being chatty or informal.
- Use natural, precise language; a light touch of warmth is fine. Avoid robotic phrasing.
- Write for a public technical audience. Be clear, concise, and skimmable.
- Be direct and trade-off aware. No marketing fluff. No robotic phrasing.
- Favor verbs, short sentences, and bullet lists. Keep code to a minimum (or none).
- Prefer concrete examples and constraints (scale, latency, failure mode) over generic advice.
- Use neutral language: avoid tasks/imperatives directed at the reader (no "do X", "set Y").
- Avoid organization-specific references (no "team channel", "our", "we", "your process").
- Avoid colloquialisms like "short on time"; prefer precise, neutral wording.

## Page template (copy per topic)

```md
---
id: <kebab-id-like-topic-overview>
title: <Concise, action-oriented title for the topic>
description: <One-line value statement for practitioners>
sidebar_label: <Short label>
tags: [overview, <topic>]
# slug: </docs/<category>/<topic>/overview> # enable if you want stable path
---

## What this is
A clear 2–3 sentence definition in plain language. Emphasize when it matters in real systems.

If you introduce abbreviations (e.g., NFRs, ADRs, SLOs, PR), expand on first use like this: Non‑Functional Requirements (NFRs).

## When to use it
- 2–10 bullets for the right moments.
- Be specific. Mention scale, constraints, or org context.

## When not to
- 2–10 bullets for anti-goals or better alternatives.

## Core decisions
- 3–10 bullets on choices that actually move the needle (e.g., boundary, data model, failure mode).
- Call out one trade-off explicitly.

## Mental model
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Client] -->|request| B[<Topic core unit>]
  B -->|reads/writes| C[(State or Dependency)]
  B -->|fails or degrades| D{Fallback/Policy}
  D -->|log/metric| E[Observability]
```md

_Figure: How the topic interacts with dependencies and failure handling._

## What to read next

- [_descriptive link text_](/docs/<category>/<topic-specific-doc>)
- [_descriptive link text_](/docs/<category>/<another-related-doc>)
- [_descriptive link text_](/docs/<category>/<reference-or-pattern>)

:::note
Orientation: _two neutral sentences that help a reader navigate or prioritize within this topic. Avoid tasks, imperatives, and org-specific references._
:::

```

## Acceptance checks (per page)

- 300–600 words, no H1 in body, headings are H2/H3.
- One Mermaid diagram with a short italic caption under the code block; node count reasonable.
- At least 3-5 internal /docs/... links using Markdown link syntax with descriptive text (no bare URLs, no .md suffix unless necessary).
- Abbreviations expanded on first use; no inline HTML (passes markdownlint MD033).
- Lint-friendly spacing: blank lines around headings, lists, and fenced code blocks (passes MD022/MD031/MD032).
- Tone: neutral public-resource style; concise, punchy, and trade-off aware.
- Build-friendly frontmatter: unique id; sensible title/description.
- No tasks/imperatives directed at readers; no org-specific references; no colloquialisms.

### Single-scope safety gates

- Exactly one file modified: the path at OVERVIEW_URL.
- No file adds, deletes, renames, or moves.
- No sidebar/config edits; no sibling writes.
- If the target file is missing, stop and request clarification; do not create it.

## Common pitfalls

- Creating new directories or variant filenames for overviews (breaks navigation and history).
- Using imperative tone or organization-specific references in overview content.
- Overlong diagrams or too many nodes; readers need orientation, not complete system maps.
- Linking to raw `.md` paths instead of routed `/docs/...` URLs.
- Forgetting to expand abbreviations on first use.

## Tooling tips

- Mermaid diagrams require `@docusaurus/theme-mermaid` enabled in `docusaurus.config.ts`.
- Run the site build locally to validate syntax and links.
- Use a link checker (for example, linkinator) on the `build/` output to catch broken internal links.

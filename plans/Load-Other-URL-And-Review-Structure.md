I want you to read all arch patterns from this url, and to make sure all of them which are not azure-specific - to be in our system. 
Also, categorized in proper categories/subcategories/... etc.

Then check yourself that:
1. No broken links
2. All titles are correct
3. All structure is concise and nested properly
4. All md files were properly created and have brief explanation of what should be there
5. On intro.md page if necessary - categories mentioned.
6. Review all docs and make sure everything is well structured, you didn't skip anyting, didn't forget anything.

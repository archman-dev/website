## Overview

This section covers practical, real-world techniques for applying DDD: collaborative workshops that discover domain structure, strategies for decomposing systems into services, integrating legacy systems safely, and aligning architecture with business needs.

## Key Techniques

### Event Storming
Collaborative workshops with domain experts and developers. Use events to discover domain structure, aggregates, and bounded contexts.

### Strategic Decomposition
Break monolithic systems into services aligned with bounded contexts and team ownership.

### Legacy Integration
Safely integrate existing systems using anti-corruption layers and context maps.

### Microservices Alignment
Map bounded contexts to microservices for team autonomy and scalability.

### Model Evolution
Strategies for refactoring and evolving domain models as understanding improves.

## When to Use These Techniques

- **Event Storming**: Early in projects, when discovering domain with domain experts
- **Strategic Decomposition**: Moving from monolith to services
- **Legacy Integration**: Integrating old and new systems
- **Microservices Alignment**: Planning service boundaries
- **Model Evolution**: Ongoing development as domain understanding matures

## Implementation Journey

1. **Discover** (Event Storming): Understand the domain through collaborative modeling
2. **Partition** (Strategic Design): Define bounded contexts and team ownership
3. **Implement** (Tactical Design): Build aggregates, entities, services within contexts
4. **Decompose** (Services): Align services with contexts
5. **Integrate** (ACLs, Events): Manage interaction between contexts
6. **Evolve** (Refactoring): Improve models as learning continues

- Learn **Event Storming**: Discover domain structure collaboratively
- Study **Microservices Alignment**: Decompose and organize services
- Explore **Legacy Integration**: Safely integrate existing systems
- Apply **Model Evolution**: Keep improving your domain models

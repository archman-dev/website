# Reliability Engineering

Reliability engineering is a discipline: systems fail, and that's okay. Plan for failure. Design for recovery. Learn from failures. Reliability comes from patterns: error budgets (you're allowed to be unreliable sometimes), redundancy (single points of failure are deadly), observability (you can't fix what you can't see).

This section covers:

- **Error Budgets and Toil**: Quantify acceptable failures; eliminate manual toil
- **Gamedays and Chaos Engineering**: Practice failure before it happens
- **Auto-Remediation and Runbooks**: Recover automatically when possible

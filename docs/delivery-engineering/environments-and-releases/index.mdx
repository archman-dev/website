# Environments and Releases

Development, testing, staging, production: each environment serves a purpose. Code flows through them from dev (fast feedback) to prod (highest safety bar). Releases are snapshots: "version 1.2.3 is in production". Release notes communicate what changed. Hotfixes apply urgent fixes. Rollbacks revert bad releases.

This section covers:

- **Environment Strategy**: Dev, test, staging, prod—roles and gates
- **Secrets and Configuration**: Manage credentials safely across environments
- **Release Versioning and Notes**: Version releases, document changes

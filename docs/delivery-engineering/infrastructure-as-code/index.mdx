# Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) means describing infrastructure (servers, databases, networks) in code and deploying via automation. Code lives in version control with history and review. Drift detection catches when reality diverges from code. IaC enables:

- **Reproducibility**: Same code → same infrastructure every time
- **Version Control**: See what changed, who changed it, why
- **Peer Review**: Infrastructure changes reviewed like code
- **Automation**: Deploy consistently, recover from disasters

# Delivery Engineering

Delivery engineering (DevOps, SRE, platform engineering) bridges development and operations: how do we get code to production safely? How do we manage infrastructure reliably? How do we recover from failures?

Good delivery engineering enables:

- **Speed**: Deploy changes multiple times per day without fear
- **Safety**: Rollbacks, staged rollouts, automated testing catch problems
- **Visibility**: Know what's running where, and what changed
- **Reliability**: Automate routine tasks; eliminate manual toil
- **Scaling**: Handle 10x traffic without proportional effort

This section covers:

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate build, test, scan, and deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define infrastructure in version control
- **Environments and Releases**: Manage dev/test/staging/prod; version releases
- **Reliability Engineering**: Error budgets, chaos engineering, automation

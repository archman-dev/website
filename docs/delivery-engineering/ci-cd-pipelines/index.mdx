# CI/CD Pipelines

Continuous Integration (CI) means every commit is built and tested. Continuous Deployment (CD) means every tested commit can be deployed. CI/CD pipelines automate these steps: code push → build → test → scan → deploy. Pipelines catch bugs early (before code review), prevent bad code reaching production (failed tests block merge), and enable rapid feedback (minutes, not days).

This section covers:

- **Build, Test, Scan**: What happens before merge
- **Promotion and Approvals**: Gates and controls for safety
- **Deployment Strategies**: Blue-green, rolling, canary—how to roll out changes

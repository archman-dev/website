## Overview

Data Protection ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and unmodified, whether stored or transmitted. It answers:

1. **In Transit**: How do we encrypt data moving between systems?
2. **At Rest**: How do we encrypt data stored in databases?
3. **Key Management**: How do we generate, store, and rotate encryption keys?
4. **Integrity**: How do we verify data hasn't been tampered with?

This section covers:

- **Encryption in Transit (TLS/mTLS)**: Secure communication channels
- **Encryption at Rest (Envelope Encryption)**: Protecting stored data
- **Key Management (HSM, KMS)**: Secure key handling
- **Hashing & Password Storage**: Irreversible data protection
- **Tokenization & Pseudonymization**: Data masking techniques

## Key Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Layer encryption, don't rely on one mechanism
- **Zero Knowledge**: Architects/operators don't have unencrypted data access
- **Key Separation**: Different keys for different data classifications
- **Rotation**: Regularly replace encryption keys
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements (HIPAA, PCI, GDPR)

## Common Challenges

- **Key Management Complexity**: Where and how to store keys?
- **Performance Impact**: Encryption adds latency; balance security and speed
- **Backward Compatibility**: Rotating encryption keys while supporting old data
- **Compliance Alignment**: Different regulations require different approaches
- **Visibility**: Can't easily search encrypted data (unless using advanced techniques)

## Encryption Fundamentals

- **Symmetric**: One key encrypts and decrypts (AES-256, ChaCha20). Fast, scalable.
- **Asymmetric**: Public key encrypts, private key decrypts (RSA, ECDSA). Enables key exchange.
- **Hashing**: One-way function. Hash("password") ≠ Hash("password") reversible. Used for verification.

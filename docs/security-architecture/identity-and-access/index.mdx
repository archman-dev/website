## Overview

Identity & Access is the cornerstone of zero trust security. It answers three critical questions:

1. **Who are you?** (Authentication)
2. **What can you do?** (Authorization)
3. **How do you prove it?** (Credentials & Tokens)

This section covers:

- **Authentication & Federation**: How users prove their identity using MFA, SSO, and identity providers
- **Authorization Models**: RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC, and PBAC for granular access control
- **Session & Token Management**: JWT, opaque tokens, refresh tokens, and rotation strategies
- **Secrets Management**: Vaults, KMS, encryption keys, and secure rotation

## Key Principles

- **Never trust, always verify**: Every request must be authenticated and authorized
- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary access, revoke when done
- **Defense in depth**: Layer authentication (MFA), isolation (segmentation), monitoring (anomalies)
- **Separation of duties**: Different roles for checking, approving, and executing sensitive operations

## Challenges

- **Credential management**: Where and how to securely store passwords, API keys, certificates?
- **User experience vs security**: MFA is secure but adds friction
- **Federated identity**: Managing identity across multiple systems and organizations
- **Token lifecycle**: Balancing security (short-lived) with usability (refresh tokens)
- **Privilege escalation**: Detecting and preventing unauthorized access to higher-privileged resources

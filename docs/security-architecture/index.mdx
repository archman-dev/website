## Overview

Security isn't added at the end; it's woven into architecture from day one. **Secure by Design** means:

- **Principles first**: CIA triad, zero trust, least privilege, defense in depth shape decisions
- **Threat-aware**: Identify assets, attack surfaces, trust boundaries before designing
- **Resilient**: Assume breaches will happen; minimize damage and enable recovery
- **Proactive**: Threat model, attack surface analysis, and red teaming reveal vulnerabilities

This section covers security architecture at scale:

### Key Areas

- **Principles & Models**: CIA triad, zero trust, least privilege, separation of duties, defense in depth, secure defaults, complete mediation, fail securely
- **Threat Modeling**: STRIDE, LINDDUN, PASTA frameworks for identifying threats systematically
- **Assets & Attack Surfaces**: What are you protecting? Where are the weak points?
- **Identity & Access**: Authentication, authorization, roles, policies
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, key management, data classification
- **Network Security**: Segmentation, firewalls, DDOS protection
- **Application Security**: Input validation, injection prevention, secure coding
- **Operations**: Incident response, compliance, monitoring, penetration testing

Security architecture is not a feature or a checkbox. It's a mindset: assume the worst, design for resilience, and continuously improve.

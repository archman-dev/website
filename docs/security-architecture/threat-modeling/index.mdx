## Overview

**Threat modeling** is the process of systematically identifying, analyzing, and addressing security threats before they become breaches. It answers: What could go wrong? Who might attack? Where are we vulnerable?

### Why Threat Model?

- **Proactive**: Find vulnerabilities before attackers do
- **Comprehensive**: Don't miss threat categories (data theft, availability, integrity)
- **Prioritization**: Focus on highest-impact risks
- **Communication**: Align team on security concerns
- **Documentation**: Understand what you're protecting

### Threat Modeling Frameworks

- **STRIDE**: Microsoft's per-element threat categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Info Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
- **LINDDUN**: Privacy-focused (Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of Information, Unawareness, Non-compliance)
- **PASTA**: Attack path-focused (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
- **Attack Trees**: Visual representation of attack paths toward goals

### When to Threat Model

- **High-risk systems**: Financial, medical, critical infrastructure
- **New designs**: Before building, not after
- **Major changes**: New integrations, data handling
- **Post-incident**: Analyze what happened, prevent recurrence
- **Regularly**: Annual threat model refresh as threats evolve

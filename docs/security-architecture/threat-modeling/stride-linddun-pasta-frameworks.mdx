## TL;DR

**STRIDE** (Microsoft) is element-based: identify threats per system component (Spoofing identity, Tampering data, Repudiation of actions, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege). **LINDDUN** (KU Leuven) focuses on privacy threats (Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure, Unawareness, Non-compliance). **PASTA** (attack-centric) works backward from attacker goals to identify attack paths. Choose based on your priority: STRIDE for general security, LINDDUN for privacy-heavy systems, PASTA for understanding attacker motivation.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply STRIDE to identify security threats
- Use LINDDUN for privacy threat analysis
- Conduct PASTA (attack path) analysis
- Choose appropriate framework for context
- Create actionable threat models
- Prioritize mitigations by impact and likelihood

## Motivating Scenario

Your team designed a health data sharing platform. Everyone agrees it should be secure. But "secure" means different things: prevent tampering (STRIDE's Tampering), prevent patient linking across systems (LINDDUN's Linkability), or stop an attacker from gaining system access (PASTA's attack tree). Without a shared framework, threat modeling is chaotic and incomplete.

## Core Concepts

### STRIDE Framework

Microsoft's element-centric approach. For each system component, ask: What STRIDE threats exist?

| Threat | Definition | Example | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Spoofing** | Pretend to be someone/something else | Attacker claims to be user Alice | Authentication (password, MFA, certs) |
| **Tampering** | Modify data/code in transit or at rest | Attacker modifies transaction amount | Checksums, encryption, digital signatures |
| **Repudiation** | Deny performing an action | "I didn't approve that payment" | Audit logs, digital signatures, non-repudiation |
| **Information Disclosure** | Unauthorized access to data | Attacker reads customer emails | Encryption, access control |
| **Denial of Service** | Make system unavailable | DOS attack overwhelms server | Rate limiting, redundancy, DNS protection |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Gain higher permissions than authorized | User escalates to admin | Authorization checks, least privilege |

### LINDDUN Framework

Privacy-centric (important for GDPR, CCPA compliance). Ask: What privacy risks exist?

| Threat | Definition | Example | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Linkability** | Link user actions across systems | Device fingerprinting correlates users | Anonymization, data minimization |
| **Identifiability** | Identify individual from data | De-identified dataset re-identified | Differential privacy, aggregation |
| **Non-repudiation** | User can't deny action | Audit logs prove user deleted data | Consent, transparency, user control |
| **Detectability** | Presence/absence of info detectable | Timing side-channel reveals algorithm | Constant-time operations |
| **Disclosure** | Unauthorized access to info | Memory dump reveals encryption keys | Encryption, secure storage |
| **Unawareness** | User unaware of data collection | Hidden tracking, fingerprinting | Transparency, consent |
| **Non-compliance** | Violation of regulations | Data not deleted per GDPR request | Policy automation, compliance checks |

### PASTA Framework

Attack-centric. Works backward from attacker goals to identify exploitable paths.

**Stages**:
1. **Identify stakeholders and assets**: What do attackers want?
2. **Define attack scenarios**: What paths lead to asset compromise?
3. **Analyze attack feasibility**: How likely and difficult?
4. **Enumerate controls**: What defends against this?
5. **Recommend mitigations**: What closes the gap?

## Practical Example

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="stride" label="STRIDE Analysis">

```
System: User Login Service

[User] ---(username/password)---> [Auth Server] ---(session token)---> [Client]

STRIDE Threats:

Spoofing:
  - Attacker claims to be user by guessing password
  - Mitigation: Strong password policy, rate limiting, MFA

Tampering:
  - Attacker modifies session token
  - Mitigation: Cryptographic signing, timestamp validation

Repudiation:
  - User claims they didn't log in from X IP
  - Mitigation: Audit logs with IP, timestamp, device

Information Disclosure:
  - Password transmitted in plaintext
  - Mitigation: HTTPS/TLS encryption

Denial of Service:
  - Attacker floods login endpoint with requests
  - Mitigation: Rate limiting, CAPTCHA after N failures

Elevation of Privilege:
  - User with limited access claims admin role
  - Mitigation: Role validation, authorization checks
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linddun" label="LINDDUN Privacy Analysis">

```
System: Health Data Sharing Platform

LINDDUN Threats:

Linkability:
  - Attacker correlates patient visits across time/clinics
  - Mitigation: Anonymization, pseudonyms, no persistent IDs

Identifiability:
  - De-identified health record re-identified via public info
  - Example: "40-year-old female from ZIP 12345 with rare disease" = 1 person
  - Mitigation: Differential privacy, aggregation, coarsening

Non-repudiation:
  - Patient shares data, later claims non-consent
  - Mitigation: Signed consent, audit trail

Detectability:
  - Presence of data reveals info (e.g., patient sought psychiatry = mental health issue)
  - Mitigation: Dummy records, hiding access patterns

Disclosure:
  - Database breach exposes health records
  - Mitigation: Encryption, key separation, access control

Unawareness:
  - Platform secretly shares data with researchers
  - Mitigation: Explicit consent, transparency

Non-compliance:
  - Patient requests data deletion; not honored
  - Mitigation: Automated deletion, compliance audits
```

```
Attacker Goal: Exfiltrate customer database

Attack Path Analysis:

Goal: Access Database
├── Path 1: SQL Injection
│   ├── Attacker crafts malicious SQL in login form
│   ├── Application concatenates unescaped SQL
│   ├── Attacker retrieves entire database
│   └── Mitigation: Parameterized queries
│
├── Path 2: Compromise Web Server
│   ├── Attacker scans for outdated framework versions
│   ├── Applies known exploit
│   ├── Gains code execution on server
│   ├── Connects to database as app user
│   └── Mitigation: Patching, Web Application Firewall
│
└── Path 3: Steal DBA Credentials
    ├── Attacker socially engineers DBA
    ├── Gains VPN access
    ├── Connects directly to database
    └── Mitigation: MFA, access logging, network segmentation

High-Risk Paths: SQL Injection (easiest), DBA compromise (highest impact)
Prioritize: Fix SQL Injection first (low effort), then MFA (prevents DBA path)
```

## Choosing a Framework

**Use STRIDE when**:
- General security assessment needed
- Per-element analysis preferred
- Addressing CIA triad concerns

**Use LINDDUN when**:
- Privacy is primary concern
- GDPR, CCPA, health data compliance
- Tracking and identification risks

**Use PASTA when**:
- Understanding attacker motivation
- Prioritizing high-impact paths
- Red team exercises

**Combine them**: Large systems use multiple. STRIDE catches authentication flaws; LINDDUN catches privacy leaks; PASTA identifies highest-risk paths.

## Framework Comparison and Selection

| Framework | Focus | Best For | Effort |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| STRIDE | Security (CIA) | General applications | 2-3 hours |
| LINDDUN | Privacy (GDPR compliance) | Data-heavy systems | 2-3 hours |
| PASTA | Attacker perspective | Red team exercises | 4-6 hours |

**Recommendation**: Start with STRIDE (fastest), add LINDDUN if privacy critical, use PASTA for complex systems.

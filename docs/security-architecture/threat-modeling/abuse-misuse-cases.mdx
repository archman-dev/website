<Hero title="Abuse and Misuse Cases" subtitle="Think like an attacker to find vulnerabilities" imageAlt="Adversarial thinking illustration" size="large" />

## TL;DR

**Use Cases** describe normal user workflows (Actor: User, Goal: Buy product). **Abuse Cases** describe malicious actors exploiting the system (Actor: Fraudster, Goal: Charge credit cards without payment). **Misuse Cases** describe mistakes or negligence (Actor: Employee, Goal: [Accidentally] Delete customer data). Where use cases assume good intent, abuse/misuse cases assume bad intent or mistakes. This complementary view catches vulnerabilities functional requirements miss.

## Learning Objectives

- Distinguish use cases from abuse/misuse cases
- Identify malicious actors and motivations
- Design workflows resilient to abuse
- Think adversarially about features
- Test for misuse scenarios

## Motivating Scenario

A team designs a photo-sharing feature: "Users upload photos, share with friends, set privacy to public/private." The use case is happy path. But abuse cases:
- Attacker uploads child exploitation material
- User impersonates another user's photos
- Attacker scrapes all public photos at scale

Misuse cases:
- Employee accidentally deletes all photos due to buggy migration
- User marks thousands of false DMCA claims to censor content

These scenarios weren't in the use case but deeply affect design.

## Core Concepts

### Use Case vs Abuse Case vs Misuse Case

**Use Case** (Normal):
```
Actor: Alice
Goal: Share vacation photos
Precondition: Alice has photos
Main Flow:
  1. Upload photos to system
  2. Select friends to share with
  3. Set privacy to "shared with selected"
Postcondition: Friends can view photos
```

**Abuse Case** (Malicious):
```
Actor: Bob (Fraudster)
Goal: Steal payment methods via fake service
Precondition: Bob has fake website
Attack Flow:
  1. Create fake reviews to build reputation
  2. Trick user into sharing payment method
  3. Charge unauthorized amounts
  4. Delete transaction records
Postcondition: User discovers fraudulent charges; reputation destroyed
```

**Misuse Case** (Negligent):
```
Actor: Carol (Developer)
Goal: Clear old photos [to reduce storage costs]
Precondition: Carol has database admin access
Negligent Flow:
  1. Runs DELETE from photos WHERE created_at < '2020-01-01'
  2. Typo: WHERE clause evaluates to true
  3. Deletes all photos in database
Postcondition: System down; customer data lost
```

### Malicious Actors

Common attacker profiles to consider:

| Actor | Motivation | Capabilities | Example Attack |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| External Hacker | Steal data, ransom, glory | High technical skill, time | SQL injection, brute force |
| Fraudster | Financial gain | Medium skill, social engineering | Fake reviews, payment fraud |
| Competitor | Damage reputation | High motivation, some technical skill | Scrape data, DOS |
| Disgruntled Employee | Revenge | High access, knowledge of systems | Delete data, steal secrets |
| Casual Script Kiddy | Entertainment | Low skill, uses existing tools | Automated scanning, exploitation |
| State Actor | Espionage, sabotage | Unlimited resources | Advanced zero-days, supply chain attacks |

## Brainstorming Abuse Cases

Ask questions systematically:

**Motivation**:
- What could an attacker gain? (Money, data, reputation, disruption)
- Who would want to hurt this system? (Competitors, insiders, ideological)

**Capability**:
- What technical skills required? (Script kiddie vs nation-state)
- What access required? (None, user account, admin access)

**Attack Vector**:
- What features could be abused? (Sharing, uploads, permissions, payments)
- What happens if normal flow bypassed? (Authentication skipped, validation removed)

**Business Impact**:
- What's the worst outcome? (Data loss, reputation, legal liability)
- How long could it go undetected? (Hours, weeks, months)

## Design Review Checklist

- [ ] Abuse cases identified for each feature
- [ ] Common attacker profiles considered (hacker, fraudster, insider, competitor)
- [ ] Mitigations designed for high-impact abuse cases
- [ ] Rate limiting in place
- [ ] Audit logging captures suspicious activity
- [ ] Anomaly detection or monitoring alerts on abuse patterns
- [ ] Misuse cases tested (employee mistakes, accidental deletes)
- [ ] Permissions enforced (user can't exceed role)
- [ ] Sensitive actions require extra verification (confirm/OTP)
- [ ] Recovery possible if abuse occurs (backups, audit restore)

## Self-Check

- Name three abuse cases for a social media platform
- What misuse case could happen if permissions are misconfigured?
- Which attacker type would be hardest to stop: external hacker or insider?

:::info One Takeaway
Normal use cases show how users should behave; abuse cases show how attackers will behave. Both matter.

## Advanced Scenarios and Mitigations

### Financial Services Abuse Cases

```
NORMAL USE CASE:
Actor: Customer
Goal: Transfer money between accounts
Flow: Login → Select recipient → Confirm amount → Transfer complete

ABUSE CASES:

1. Account Takeover via Credential Stuffing
   Actor: Attacker
   Precondition: Attacker has list of leaked credentials from other breaches
   Goal: Access customer account
   Attack: Try credentials on login endpoint repeatedly
   Impact: Full account access, fund theft
   Mitigation:
     - MFA (blocks 99% of takeovers)
     - Rate limiting (max 5 attempts per minute)
     - Velocity checks (flag unusual IP/device)
     - Lockout after N failed attempts
     - Monitor for credential stuffing patterns

2. Authorized Push Payment Fraud
   Actor: Attacker (via social engineering)
   Goal: Trick user into transferring to attacker's account
   Attack: Call/SMS impersonating bank, claim fraud, convince customer to "move funds to safe account"
   Impact: Customer loses money (banks often deny refund)
   Mitigation:
     - Customer education (banks never ask to move funds)
     - Transaction delay (24 hours for new payees)
     - Payee verification (second factor)
     - Transaction limits (large transfers require extra verification)

3. API Rate Limiting Bypass
   Actor: Competitor
   Goal: Enumerate valid accounts or DOS service
   Attack: Script automated queries to balance check endpoint
   Impact: Service overload, privacy disclosure
   Mitigation:
     - Per-user rate limits, not just per-IP
     - Exponential backoff penalties
     - CAPTCHA after N requests
     - Audit logging for abuse patterns

MISUSE CASES:

1. Batch Processing Error
   Actor: Operations team
   Precondition: Running monthly reconciliation job
   Goal: [Accidentally] double-process refunds
   Negligent Flow: Cron job runs twice due to misconfiguration, processes refunds twice
   Impact: Customers over-refunded, financial liability
   Mitigation:
     - Idempotent processing (safe to retry)
     - Duplicate detection
     - Cron job monitoring (alert on unexpected runs)
     - Test refund logic thoroughly

2. Insufficient Access Control on Admin Endpoints
   Actor: Customer service rep
   Precondition: CSR account with limited permissions
   Goal: [Accidentally] escalate own privileges
   Negligent Flow: CSR can view user admin panel due to missing role check
   Impact: Rogue CSR can modify accounts, transfer funds
   Mitigation:
     - Role-based access control (check role on every operation)
     - Principle of least privilege (CSR can only view, not modify)
     - Audit logging of admin actions
     - Segregation of duties
```

### IoT/Connected Devices Abuse Cases

```
NORMAL USE CASE:
Actor: User
Goal: Control smart home devices via app
Flow: Open app → Select device → Send command → Device responds

ABUSE CASES:

1. API Key Leakage
   Actor: Attacker
   Precondition: API key found in decompiled app or GitHub
   Goal: Control devices remotely
   Attack: Call device control APIs with stolen key
   Impact: User's home controlled remotely, privacy violation
   Mitigation:
     - Keys in secure enclave, not decompiled app
     - Key rotation on compromise
     - Per-device tokens (revoke without affecting others)
     - Rate limiting + anomaly detection on API

2. Man-in-the-Middle Attack
   Actor: Attacker on local WiFi
   Goal: Intercept and modify device commands
   Attack: Downgrade HTTPS to HTTP, inject malicious commands
   Impact: Device malfunction, potential safety hazard
   Mitigation:
     - Certificate pinning
     - TLS 1.2+ enforced
     - Command signing (device validates authenticity)
     - Over-the-air update signing

3. Reverse Engineering Firmware
   Actor: Competitor
   Goal: Steal proprietary algorithms
   Attack: Extract firmware from device, decompile
   Impact: IP theft, market advantage lost
   Mitigation:
     - Code obfuscation
     - Secure boot (verify firmware signature before execution)
     - Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for key storage
     - Regular security audits
```

## Threat Modeling Workshop

Running an effective abuse/misuse case workshop:

**Preparation** (1 hour):
- Gather architects, engineers, security team
- Define system scope (what features to analyze)
- Create simple architecture diagram
- List known threat actors relevant to your domain

**Brainstorming** (2-3 hours):
- Go feature-by-feature through normal use cases
- Ask: "What if an attacker..."
- Document all threats (don't filter during brainstorm)
- Group similar threats (pattern matching)

**Analysis** (1-2 hours):
- Estimate impact (low, medium, high)
- Estimate likelihood (low, medium, high)
- Map to known attack types (STRIDE, LINDDUN)
- Identify dependencies (fixing threat A prevents threat B)

**Mitigation** (1-2 hours):
- Brainstorm controls for high-impact threats
- Assign ownership (who implements?)
- Set timeline (critical by Q1, important by Q2)
- Document assumptions and residual risk

**Follow-up**:
- Threat model is living document, update quarterly
- Include in design review process for new features
- Run red team exercises quarterly
- Share findings with team for learning

## Real-World Examples

### Case Study 1: Instagram Photo Privacy

**Normal Use Case**: User uploads photo, selects privacy (public/followers/private)

**Abuse Case**: Attacker discovers information disclosure via search API
- API allows searching photos by location metadata
- Attacker can enumerate all private account photos at a specific location
- Mitigation: Strip location metadata on upload, rate-limit search API

### Case Study 2: Venmo Payment Visibility

**Normal Use Case**: User sends payment to friend with note

**Privacy Misuse Case**: Transactions are public by default
- Researchers analyzed Venmo public data to infer drug dealers, salaries, relationships
- Mitigation: Private by default (changed after publicity), opt-in public sharing

### Case Study 3: Cloud Storage Default Sharing

**Normal Use Case**: User uploads file to cloud storage

**Misuse Case**: Developer accidentally makes file world-readable due to misconfigured bucket permissions
- Tens of thousands of databases, medical records exposed
- Mitigation: Default-deny permissions, warnings on public sharing, audit logging

## Next Steps

- Read **STRIDE, LINDDUN, PASTA** for systematic threat analysis
- Study **Implementation** for specific defenses
- Explore **Incident Response** for handling breaches when abuse occurs
- Conduct threat modeling workshop for your system
- Document findings and share with stakeholders

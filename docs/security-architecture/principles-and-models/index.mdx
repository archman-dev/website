<Hero title="Security Principles & Models" subtitle="Foundational concepts for building secure systems" imageAlt="Security principles illustration" size="large" />

## Overview

Security architecture rests on time-tested principles developed over decades of research and incident response. These principles transcend specific technologies—they apply whether you're building a monolith or microservices, on-premise or cloud, legacy or greenfield.

### Core Principles Covered

- **CIA Triad & Zero Trust**: Confidentiality, integrity, availability and the shift from "trust but verify" to "never trust, always verify"
- **Least Privilege & Separation of Duties**: Grant minimal permissions, distribute authority to prevent single points of failure
- **Defense in Depth**: Layered defenses so breaching one layer doesn't compromise the system
- **Secure Defaults & Complete Mediation**: Secure configurations out of the box, every access request validated
- **Fail Securely**: When systems break, break closed not open

These aren't best practices (which change). They're **principles**—enduring wisdom that shapes better decisions regardless of context.

<Hero title="Application Security" subtitle="Secure code from input validation to dependency management" imageAlt="application security illustration" size="large" />

## Overview

Application Security protects code and systems from vulnerabilities introduced during development. It covers:

- **Input Validation**: Validate all user input before processing
- **Output Encoding**: Encode output to prevent injection attacks
- **CSRF/CORS**: Prevent cross-site forgery and control resource sharing
- **Injection Attacks**: Prevent SQL, command, template, XSS, SSRF, RCE
- **Supply Chain**: Manage dependencies and verify integrity
- **Testing**: SAST, DAST, IAST, RASP for vulnerability detection

## Key Principles

- **Never trust user input**: All external data is potentially malicious
- **Defense in depth**: Layer multiple controls
- **Secure by default**: Safe defaults, explicit decisions to reduce security
- **Test continuously**: Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- **Manage dependencies**: Know what code you're running

## Common Challenges

- **Volume**: Thousands of dependencies, each with potential vulnerabilities
- **False positives**: Security tools generate noise
- **Performance**: Security scanning adds build time
- **Legacy code**: Difficult to retrofit security into old systems
- **Developer friction**: Security shouldn't block productivity

## Next Steps

Explore each topic to build security into your development practices.

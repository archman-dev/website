## Overview

Architecture decisions shape systems. ADRs document the what, why, and alternatives, creating a decision log for future developers and decisions makers.

### Core Topics

1. **Template & Rationale** – ADR format, sections, and how to write them.

2. **Catalog & Traceability** – Organizing ADRs and linking to code/docs.

3. **Linking to Code & Docs** – Making decisions discoverable and actionable.

## Overview

Architecture exists in code and in minds; documentation makes it explicit, discoverable, and traceable. This section covers architecture decision records (ADRs), viewpoint models (4+1, C4), diagramming tools, and reference architectures.

### Core Domains

1. **Views & Viewpoints** – 4+1 Model, C4 Model for multi-level architecture representation.

2. **Diagramming & Notation** – UML, diagrams-as-code (PlantUML, Mermaid), and governance.

3. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** – Capture decisions, rationale, and alternatives.

4. **Reference Architectures & Playbooks** – Common stacks, checklists, risk registers.

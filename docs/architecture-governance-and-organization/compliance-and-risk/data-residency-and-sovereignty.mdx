<Hero title="Data Residency & Sovereignty" subtitle="Manage where data physically resides and who can access it, respecting legal boundaries and customer requirements." imageAlt="data residency & sovereignty illustration" size="large" />

## TL;DR

Data residency specifies where data physically resides (storage location). Data sovereignty specifies who can access and control data (legal/business rules). Example: EU customers' data must reside in EU data centers and cannot be accessed by non-EU employees. Violating this creates legal liability, regulatory fines, and customer trust issues. Plan early: where your data lives affects architecture, infrastructure, and operations.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose and scope of data residency & sovereignty
- Learn practical implementation approaches and best practices
- Recognize common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Build sustainable processes that scale with your organization
- Mentor others in applying these principles effectively
- Map regulatory requirements to technical constraints
- Design multi-region architectures respecting data boundaries
- Implement access controls reflecting sovereignty requirements
- Document data residency and sovereignty in architecture

## Motivating Scenario

Your organization faces a challenge that data residency & sovereignty directly addresses. Without clear processes and alignment, teams work in silos, making duplicate decisions or conflicting choices.

Real situation: Your US-based SaaS company operates in EU. You store all customer data in AWS us-east-1 (Virginia). GDPR requires personal data of EU residents to stay within EU. You discover a customer filed a complaint. Data of their 50 EU employees is in the US. GDPR fine: 20 million euros or 4% of revenue, whichever is higher.

Even worse: your backup system copies everything to a global read-only replica for disaster recovery. Technically the data left the EU. Violation.

This section provides frameworks, templates, and practices to move forward with confidence and coherence.

## Core Concepts

### Key Terms

**Data Residency**: Physical location where data is stored. Example: "Customer data must reside in AWS eu-central-1."

**Data Sovereignty**: Legal/political control and jurisdiction over data. Example: "EU data cannot be accessed by US employees."

**Personal Data**: Any information identifying a real person. Example: names, emails, IP addresses.

**Sensitive Data**: Additional categories requiring stricter control. Example: payment info, health data, biometric data.

**Jurisdiction**: Legal authority governing the data. GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), LGPD (Brazil), etc.

### Common Regulatory Requirements

| Regulation | Scope | Key Requirement |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| GDPR | EU residents | Data in EU, accessible to EU authorities only |
| CCPA | California residents | Right to delete, right to know, opt-out |
| LGPD | Brazil residents | Data in Brazil or with consent to transfer |
| SOC 2 | All customers | Audited security controls |
| HIPAA | Healthcare data (US) | Encrypted, limited access, audit logs |
| PCI-DSS | Payment cards | Encrypted, isolated from other systems |

### Purpose and Value

Data Residency & Sovereignty matters because it creates clarity without creating bureaucracy. When processes are lightweight and transparent, teams understand what decisions matter and can move fast with safety.

### Key Principles

1. **Clarity:** Make the "why" behind processes explicit
2. **Lightweight:** Every process should create more value than it costs
3. **Transparency:** Document criteria so teams know what to expect
4. **Evolution:** Regularly review and refine based on experience
5. **Participation:** Include affected teams in designing processes

### Implementation Pattern

Most successful implementations follow this pattern: understand current state, design minimal viable process, pilot with early adopters, gather feedback, refine, and scale.

### Governance Without Bureaucracy

The hard part is scaling without creating approval bottlenecks. This requires clear decision criteria, asynchronous review mechanisms, and truly delegating decisions to teams.

# Governance Approach

Decision Tier 1: Team-Level (Own It)
  - Internal team decisions
  - No cross-team impact
  - Timeline: Team decides
  - Authority: Tech Lead
  - Process: Documented in code review

Decision Tier 2: Cross-Team (Collaborate)
  - Affects multiple teams or shared systems
  - Requires coordination
  - Timeline: 1-2 weeks
  - Authority: System/Solution Architect
  - Process: ADR review, stakeholder feedback

Decision Tier 3: Org-Level (Align)
  - Organization-wide impact
  - Strategic implications
  - Timeline: 2-4 weeks
  - Authority: Enterprise Architect
  - Process: Design review, exception evaluation

Escape Hatch: Exception
  - Justified deviation from standard
  - Time-boxed (3-6 months)
  - Requires rationale and review plan
  - Authority: Role + affected team lead

## Core Principles in Practice

1. **Make the Why Clear:** Teams will follow processes they understand the purpose of
2. **Delegate Authority:** Push decisions down; keep strategy centralized
3. **Use Asynchronous Review:** Documents and ADRs scale better than meetings
4. **Measure Impact:** Track metrics that show whether process is working
5. **Iterate Quarterly:** Regular review keeps processes relevant

## Success Indicators

✓ Teams proactively engage in the process
✓ 80%+ adoption without enforcement
✓ Clear reduction in the pain point the process addresses
✓ Minimal time overhead (less than 5% of team capacity)
✓ Positive feedback in retrospectives

## Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Process theater:** Requiring documentation no one reads
❌ **Over-standardization:** Same rules for all teams and all decisions
❌ **Changing frequently:** Processes need 3-6 months to stabilize
❌ **Ignoring feedback:** Refusing to adapt based on experience
❌ **One-size-fits-all:** Different teams need different process levels
❌ **No documentation:** Unwritten processes get inconsistently applied

## Related Concepts

This practice connects to:
- Architecture Governance & Organization (overall structure)
- Reliability & Resilience (ensuring systems stay healthy)
- Documentation & ADRs (capturing decisions and rationale)
- Team Structure & Communication (enabling effective collaboration)

## Checklist: Before You Implement

- [ ] Clear problem statement: "This process solves [X]"
- [ ] Stakeholder input: Teams that will use it helped design it
- [ ] Minimal viable version: Start simple, add complexity only if needed
- [ ] Success metrics: Define what "better" looks like
- [ ] Communication plan: How will people learn about this?
- [ ] Pilot plan: Early adopters to validate before scaling
- [ ] Review schedule: When will we revisit and refine?

## Self-Check

1. **Can you explain the purpose of this process in one sentence?** If not, it's too complex.
2. **Do 80% of teams engage without being forced?** If not, reconsider its value.
3. **Have you measured the actual impact?** Or are you assuming it works?
4. **When did you last gather feedback?** If >3 months, do it now.

## Takeaway

The best processes are rarely the most comprehensive ones. They're the ones teams choose to follow because they see the value. Start lightweight, measure impact, gather feedback, and iterate. A simple process that 90% of teams adopt is infinitely better than a perfect process that 30% of teams bypass.

## Next Steps

1. **Define the problem:** What specifically are you trying to solve?
2. **Understand current state:** How do teams work today?
3. **Design minimally:** What's the smallest change that creates value?
4. **Pilot with volunteers:** Find early adopters who see the value
5. **Gather feedback:** Weekly for the first month, then monthly
6. **Refine and scale:** Incorporate feedback and expand gradually

## Architectural Patterns

### Pattern: Data Residency by Region

Separate databases per region, replicated minimally:

```
US Customers → AWS us-east-1 (US database)
              ↓
              Backup (us-west-2, still US)

EU Customers → AWS eu-central-1 (EU database)
             ↓
             Backup (eu-west-1, still EU)

Shared Services (logs, metrics) → Global (anonymized only)
```

### Pattern: Data Classification

Tag data by sensitivity and location requirements:

```python
class DataTag:
    PERSONAL_EU = "personal:eu"      # GDPR-protected
    PERSONAL_US = "personal:us"      # CCPA-protected
    PAYMENT = "sensitive:payment"    # PCI-DSS
    HEALTH = "sensitive:health"      # HIPAA
    ANONYMOUS = "public:anonymous"   # No residency requirement
```

### Pattern: Access Control by Jurisdiction

```python
# Only EU employees can access EU data
@requires_jurisdiction("EU")
def get_customer_data(customer_id):
    return database_eu.query(customer_id)

# Only US employees can access US data
@requires_jurisdiction("US")
def get_customer_data(customer_id):
    return database_us.query(customer_id)

# Logs can be global if anonymized
@anonymous_only
def log_event(event):
    return global_log_service.store(event)
```

## Pitfalls and Mitigations

### Pitfall: Backups Cross Borders

Your primary data is in-region, but backups go global. This violates GDPR.

**Mitigation**: Backup location must respect residency. Use regional backup services.

### Pitfall: Logging Captures Personal Data

Your logging system logs all requests, including personal data. Logs go to a global system. Violation.

**Mitigation**: Redact personal data before logging. Or keep logs in-region.

### Pitfall: Analytics and Metrics Mix Data

Your analytics system aggregates data from all regions to a central data warehouse. Now personal data is outside its jurisdiction.

**Mitigation**: Aggregate at the source. Compute metrics in each region, send only metrics (numbers, no personal data) globally.

# Testing Pyramid

The testing pyramid organizes tests by scope and speed:

- **Unit tests** (bottom, many): Test individual functions in isolation.
- **Integration tests** (middle): Test modules/services together.
- **Contract/CDC tests** (middle): Test API contracts between services.
- **System/E2E tests** (upper): Test complete user flows.
- **Acceptance/UAT** (top, few): Validate against business requirements.

Each level builds on the previous: unit tests catch bugs early and fast; system tests validate end-to-end.

# Test Environments

Test environments are where tests run before production. They must be fast, realistic, and respect data privacy.

## What you'll find here

- **[Ephemeral Environments and Preview Apps](./ephemeral-environments-and-preview-apps/)** — Spin up and tear down environments per PR or feature.
- **[Data Seeding and Masking](./data-seeding-and-masking/)** — Populate test data; mask sensitive fields.
- **[Parity with Production](./parity-with-production/)** — Staging should mirror production.

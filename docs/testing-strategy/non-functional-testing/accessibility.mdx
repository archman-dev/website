<Hero title="Accessibility Testing" subtitle="Ensure systems work for users with disabilities and comply with accessibility standards." size="large" />

## TL;DR

Accessibility testing ensures systems work for users with disabilities (visual, hearing, motor, cognitive). WCAG 2.1 is the standard: **Level A** (basic), **Level AA** (recommended), **Level AAA** (advanced). Most organizations target AA. Test for: color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text), alt text on images, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, captions on videos, form labels. Use automated tools (axe, Lighthouse) to catch common issues; manual testing with actual assistive technologies (screen readers, magnifiers) to find edge cases. Accessibility is not an afterthought—design and test from the start.

## Learning Objectives

After reading this article, you will understand:

- WCAG 2.1 standards and accessibility levels (A, AA, AAA)
- Common accessibility issues and how to fix them
- Automated vs. manual accessibility testing
- How to test with assistive technologies (screen readers, voice control)
- Accessible design patterns and best practices
- How to integrate accessibility testing into development workflow

## Motivating Scenario

Your e-commerce site works great for most users. But when a blind user tries to purchase with a screen reader, they can't complete checkout because form fields aren't labeled. A hearing-impaired user can't watch your product demos because videos lack captions. A motor-impaired user can't navigate using just the keyboard because focus indicators are invisible.

Accessibility testing catches this: Automated tests find missing alt text and poor color contrast. Manual testing with actual assistive technologies uncovers keyboard navigation and screen reader issues. By testing with accessibility in mind, you serve all users.

## Core Concepts

### WCAG 2.1 Standards

<Figure caption="WCAG 2.1 defines three conformance levels; most target Level AA">

```
</Figure>

**Four Principles (POUR):**
1. **Perceivable**: Users can see/hear content (color contrast, alt text, captions)
2. **Operable**: Users can navigate (keyboard, focus indicators, no traps)
3. **Understandable**: Content is clear (plain language, consistent labels)
4. **Robust**: Works with assistive technologies (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)

### Common Accessibility Issues and Fixes

| Issue | Problem | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Poor color contrast | Unreadable for low-vision users | Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio |
| Missing alt text | Images invisible to screen readers | Add descriptive alt text |
| No keyboard navigation | Can't use without mouse | Use Tab key, focus indicators |
| Unlabeled form fields | Screen readers can't explain fields | `<label>` tags or ARIA labels |
| No video captions | Deaf users can't watch | Add captions/transcripts |
| Unclear focus indicator | Can't see where keyboard is | Add visible focus styling |
| Color-only information | Colorblind users miss meaning | Use icons, patterns, labels too |

## Self-Check Questions

- **Q: What's the difference between WCAG A, AA, and AAA?** A: A = basic (bare minimum), AA = enhanced (recommended), AAA = advanced (hard to achieve). Most target AA.

- **Q: Why is alt text important?** A: Screen reader users can't see images. Alt text describes the image. Decorative images can have empty alt="".

- **Q: Can you just use color to show errors?** A: No. Color-blind users won't see it. Add an icon, text, or other indicator too.

- **Q: Is keyboard navigation just for screen reader users?** A: No. People with mobility disabilities use keyboard. Motor-impaired users use switch controls. Test keyboard thoroughly.

- **Q: Do we really need captions on videos?** A: Yes. Deaf users need them. Even hearing users in loud places appreciate captions.

## Next Steps

1. **Audit current accessibility** — Run Lighthouse, axe to find issues
2. **Prioritize fixes** — Critical (blocking access) → Important → Nice-to-have
3. **Define SLOs** — "No Level A violations; minimal Level AA"
4. **Make design accessible** — Semantic HTML, color contrast, spacing
5. **Test with assistive tech** — Screen readers, magnifiers, switch control
6. **Train the team** — Accessibility isn't QA's job; everyone owns it
7. **Automate testing** — axe, Lighthouse in CI/CD
8. **Involve users** — Test with actual people who use assistive tech

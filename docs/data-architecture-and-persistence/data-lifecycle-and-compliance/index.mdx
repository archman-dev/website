<Hero title="Data Lifecycle & Compliance" subtitle="Manage data ethically through its entire lifetime" size="large" />

## Overview

Responsible data management requires planning the entire lifecycle: collection, retention, deletion, and audit. Regulations (GDPR, CCPA) mandate data protection, right to erasure, and traceability.

## Core Topics

- **Retention & Archival** - Decide how long to keep data. Archive vs delete.
- **PII Classification** - Identify sensitive data. Mask, encrypt, tokenize.
- **Right to Erasure** - GDPR requirement: delete user data on request.
- **Data Portability** - Export user data in standardized format on request.
- **Audit Trails** - Log all data access and modifications. Tamper-evident.

## Regulatory Framework

- **GDPR**: Personal data rights, right to erasure, data portability (EU)
- **CCPA**: Consumer data rights, opt-out (California)
- **HIPAA**: Protected health information (Healthcare, US)
- **SOC 2**: Security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

## Next Steps

1. **Retention & Archival** - plan data lifecycle
2. **PII Classification** - identify and protect sensitive data
3. **Right to Erasure** - implement deletion mechanisms
4. **Data Portability** - enable data export
5. **Audit Trails** - maintain compliance records

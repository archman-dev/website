<Hero title="Data Pipelines & Analytics" subtitle="Build robust data pipelines for analytics and machine learning" size="large" />

## Overview

Data pipelines move, transform, and aggregate data from operational systems to analytical systems. Batch for accuracy, streaming for latency. Data lakes for raw storage, data warehouses for structured analytics.

## Core Patterns

- **Batch vs Streaming** - High-latency accuracy vs low-latency approximation
- **ETL/ELT** - Extract-Transform-Load vs Extract-Load-Transform
- **Data Lakes & Warehouses** - Raw data storage vs curated analytics repository
- **Event Streams** - Log-based integration with Kafka, Pulsar
- **Data Quality & Governance** - Lineage, cataloging, quality checks
- **ML Features & Model Serving** - Feature stores, online/offline features

## Next Steps

1. **Batch vs Streaming** - understand trade-offs
2. **ETL/ELT** - data transformation strategies
3. **Data Lakes & Warehouses** - storage architectures
4. **Event Streams** - log-based integration
5. **Data Quality** - governance and lineage
6. **Feature Stores** - ML feature management

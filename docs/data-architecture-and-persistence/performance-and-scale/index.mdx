<Hero title="Performance & Scale" subtitle="Patterns and techniques for scaling data systems to millions of users" size="large" />

## Overview

As applications grow, data systems must scale to handle increased load while maintaining acceptable latency. This section covers proven patterns: caching layers, read replicas, sharding, and pre-computation.

## Core Patterns

- **Caching Patterns** - Write-through, write-behind, cache-aside for sub-ms latency
- **Read Replicas** - Distribute reads across replicas, writes to primary
- **Sharding** - Partition data across nodes to scale horizontally
- **Materialized Views** - Precomputed query results for instant access
- **Search Offloading** - Complex searches via Elasticsearch, analytics via data warehouse

## Scaling Challenges

1. **Read Bottleneck**: Caching + read replicas
2. **Write Bottleneck**: Sharding + async processing
3. **Query Complexity**: Materialized views + denormalization
4. **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency + cache invalidation
5. **Operational Complexity**: Monitoring, failover, rebalancing

## Next Steps

1. **Caching Patterns** - reduce database load
2. **Read Replicas** - distribute read traffic
3. **Sharding** - scale writes horizontally
4. **Materialized Views** - pre-aggregate data
5. **Search Offloading** - optimize complex queries

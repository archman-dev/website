## Overview

Different problem domains demand different architectural approaches. A real-time trading system has fundamentally different constraints than an e-commerce platform. An IoT device with kilobytes of memory faces challenges that a data center with terabytes doesn't. Machine learning systems introduce novel concerns around model serving, drift, and experiment tracking. Compliance-heavy systems require audit trails and segregation of duties.

This section explores **10 specialized domains** where architecture decisions matter most:

**Real-Time Systems** require deterministic latency, hard deadlines, and prioritized scheduling. Think embedded controllers, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.

**Streaming and Event Processing** handle unbounded data flows with exactly-once semantics, watermarks, and backpressure. Kafka, Flink, and Spark Streaming enable this.

**IoT and Edge Computing** balance constrained devices (limited CPU, memory, power) with cloud connectivity. OTA updates, gateway patterns, and device management are critical.

**Machine Learning Systems** introduce feature engineering, model serving, training/serving skew, concept drift, and the data science lifecycle alongside software engineering.

**High-Compliance Systems** (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX) require immutable audit logs, segregation of duties, access controls, and regulatory reporting—not just security.

**Gaming Systems** optimize for minimal latency, state synchronization across players, prediction and extrapolation, and massive concurrent connections.

**Embedded and Firmware** manage bare-metal constraints, interrupt-driven execution, memory-constrained algorithms, and hardware abstraction layers.

**Fintech and Payments** ensure idempotency, reconciliation, double-entry bookkeeping, fraud detection, and settlement correctness—where failures cost money.

**E-Commerce** orchestrates catalog management, cart/checkout flows, inventory allocation, dynamic pricing, and promotion engines at scale.

**Social and Communication** builds feeds (fan-out on write vs read), real-time messaging, content moderation, abuse prevention, and notification systems.

Each domain has **unique constraints, tradeoffs, and patterns**. This section provides the architectural vocabulary, decision frameworks, and practical examples to guide you.

# Availability & Reliability

Availability (is the system running?) and reliability (does it work correctly?) are core concerns. This section covers redundancy patterns, automated failover, graceful degradation under failure, and disaster recovery planning.

## What you'll find here

- **[Redundancy, Replication, and Failover](./redundancy-replication-failover/)** — Multiple instances, active-passive/active-active failover.
- **[Graceful Degradation and Feature Kill Switches](./graceful-degradation-feature-kill-switches/)** — Degrade features rather than fail completely.
- **[Disaster Recovery, RTO, RPO, and Backups](./dr-rto-rpo-backups-and-restores/)** — Plan for worst-case scenarios.

## Key concepts

- **Availability**: Uptime percentage (99.9%, 99.95%, 99.99%).
- **Reliability**: System works correctly under normal conditions.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Continues operating despite failures.
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: Target time to restore service (e.g., 15 minutes).
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: Maximum acceptable data loss (e.g., 1 hour of data).
- **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)**: Average time before next failure.
- **MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)**: Average time to fix after failure.

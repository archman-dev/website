# Anti-Patterns and Pitfalls

Anti-patterns are recurring solutions to common problems that initially appear beneficial but ultimately lead to negative consequences. This section covers architectural, design, and organizational anti-patterns that cause systems to become hard to maintain, scale, and secure.

**Key Anti-Patterns**:
- Big Ball of Mud: Unstructured, difficult to navigate codebase
- Spaghetti Code: Complex control flow without clear structure
- God Object/Class: One component doing too much
- Golden Hammer: Using one solution for all problems
- Boat Anchor and Lava Flow: Obsolete code that won't go away
- Copy-Paste Programming: Violating DRY principle
- Premature Optimization: Optimizing before profiling
- Distributed Monolith: Microservices with monolithic coupling
- Chatty Interfaces: Excessive inter-component communication
- Over-Abstracting: Too many layers of indirection
- Anemic Domain Model: Domain objects without behavior
- Shared Database: Tight coupling via shared storage
- Overuse of Patterns: Patternitis
- Flaky Tests: Non-deterministic test failures

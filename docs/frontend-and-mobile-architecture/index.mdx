## Overview

Frontend and mobile architectures shape user experience. This section covers architectural patterns, state management, performance optimization, and mobile-specific challenges like offline sync and battery constraints.

### Key Domains

1. **Frontend Architecture** – MVC/MVVM/MVI patterns, component design, state management, rendering strategies (SSR/SSG/ISR), and performance.

2. **Mobile Architecture** – MVVM, offline sync, background tasks, battery/network constraints, and app store distribution.

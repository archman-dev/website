# Foundational Concepts

Start here to ground yourself in the essentials every architect and senior engineer should internalize before diving into patterns and scale. Build a shared vocabulary and mental models we’ll reference throughout the manual.

> “Form follows function.” — Louis Sullivan

What you’ll get:

- Architecture vs. design: scope, time horizons, and trade-offs
- Systems thinking: boundaries, feedback loops, constraints
- Programming paradigms: OO, FP, reactive, and dataflow
- Distributed systems basics: CAP, consistency models, coordination, resiliency
- Data fundamentals: modeling, storage, indexing, access patterns

# Basic Distributed Systems Concepts

A concise overview of the foundational ideas you will reuse throughout the guide: latency vs throughput, concurrency and coordination, reliability under partial failures, time and clocks, idempotency, and the CAP/PACELC trade‑offs. Use this page as a mental map before diving into topic articles.

When you discuss latency budgets, queueing, or fan‑out, cross‑reference [Quality Attributes](../../quality-attributes). For coordination and connectors, pair this with [System Thinking Basics](../system-thinking-basics). For runtime hardening (timeouts, retries, jitter, circuit breakers), see [Reliability Patterns](../../reliability-resilience-and-performance-engineering/reliability-patterns/hedging-requests-timeouts-retries) and related topics in [Distributed Systems & Microservices](../../distributed-systems-and-microservices).

## What’s in scope

- Latency, throughput, and bandwidth basics with intuition for trade‑offs.
- Concurrency vs parallelism and why synchronization is required.
- Reliability under partial failure; how timeouts and backoffs shape behavior.
- Idempotency and at‑least‑once delivery realities.
- Big‑picture consistency trade‑offs (CAP, PACELC) and where to learn more.

## How to use this section

- Start with the intuition for [Latency, Throughput, Bandwidth](./latency-throughput-bandwidth) and relate it to your performance budgets in [Quality Attributes](../../quality-attributes).
- Contrast [Concurrency, Parallelism, Synchronization](./concurrency-parallelism-synchronization) with your platform’s primitives (locks, semaphores, optimistic concurrency).
- Ground reliability discussions in concrete mechanisms: [timeouts, retries, backoff](../../distributed-systems-and-microservices/resilience-and-reliability-patterns/timeouts-retries-exponential-backoff-jitter). Assume at‑least‑once; design for [idempotency](../../specialized-domains-architecture-considerations/fintech-payments-idempotency-reconciliation) at boundaries.
- Use this page as a hub, then continue to deeper articles like [CAP & PACELC](../../distributed-systems-and-microservices/fundamentals/cap-and-pacelc) and [Consistency Models & Trade‑offs](../../distributed-systems-and-microservices/fundamentals/consistency-models-and-trade-offs).

## Common pitfalls

- Treating retries as harmless without idempotency or deduplication.
- Using tight timeouts everywhere; amplify cascading failures and thundering herds.
- Over‑synchronization that caps throughput; under‑synchronization that corrupts state.
- Mixing consistency assumptions across services without explicit contracts.

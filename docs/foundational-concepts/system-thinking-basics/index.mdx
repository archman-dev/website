# System Thinking Basics

A practical starter on how to see software as systems: **components** (the parts), **connectors** (their interactions), **configurations** (how parts are arranged), **interfaces** (the boundaries), and **abstractions/encapsulation** (how we manage complexity). Use this section to build shared language before diving into styles, patterns, and operations. The goal is to form mental models that help you reason about change, risk, and evolution—not to prescribe a specific stack.

Systems thinking complements adjacent foundations. When you discuss non-functional outcomes, anchor them to the language of [Quality Attributes](../../quality-attributes). When you reason about latency, failure, and coordination, connect to [Basic Distributed Systems Concepts](../basic-distributed-systems-concepts). Boundary design and compatibility live in [API & Interface Design](../../api-and-interface-design). Day-two concerns—SLOs, telemetry, and alerting—belong in [Observability & Operations](../../observability-and-operations). Confidentiality, integrity, and access control are covered in [Security Architecture](../../security-architecture). This overview gives you the mental scaffolding to navigate those deeper sections with intent.

> “A system is more than the sum of its parts.” — Donella Meadows

## How to use this section

- Start with the building blocks in [Components, Connectors, Configurations](./components-connectors-configurations). Learn to separate responsibilities, prefer one primary connector per interaction, and tune runtime levers ([timeouts, retries, backoff](../../reliability-resilience-and-performance-engineering/reliability-patterns/hedging-requests-timeouts-retries), [circuit breakers](../../reliability-resilience-and-performance-engineering/reliability-patterns/bulkheads-circuit-breakers)).
- Define crisp boundaries in [Interfaces & Contracts](./interfaces-and-contracts). Make behavior explicit and testable over time with contract tests, versioning, and clear error models.
- Keep complexity in check with [Abstractions & Encapsulation](./abstractions-and-encapsulation). Expose stable façades; hide implementation details; enforce invariants at boundaries.

## What you’ll gain

- A shared vocabulary to discuss topology, runtime behavior, and change impact.
- Decision cues to choose between sync/async connectors and to calibrate rigor when evolving or integrating systems.
- Practical checklists for operability (SLOs, telemetry, alerting; see [Observability & Operations](../../observability-and-operations)), security (authn/z, data protection; see [Security Architecture](../../security-architecture)), and rollout safety (flags, canaries, rollback).

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- Chatty, tightly coupled calls across components; prefer fewer, well‑designed interactions.
- Treating a shared database as an integration mechanism; use explicit APIs or events instead.
- Leaky abstractions that expose vendor/transport details to consumers.

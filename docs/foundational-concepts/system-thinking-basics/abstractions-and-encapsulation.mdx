**Abstraction simplifies by focusing on the essential, while encapsulation enforces boundaries by hiding internals.** Together, they are foundational for creating systems that are robust, maintainable, and able to evolve safely.

## Scope and boundaries

- Scope: conceptual guidance and practical patterns for defining abstractions and encapsulating variability.
- Out of scope: language-specific features; see [Core Design & Programming Principles](../../core-design-and-programming-principles/) for SOLID and related principles.

## Core ideas

- **Abstraction**: Exposing what a system component does (its capabilities) while hiding how it does it. Consumers interact with a stable, well-defined interface, ignorant of the internal complexity.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling a component's data and logic together and protecting it from outside interference. This is achieved by defining explicit boundaries and preventing direct access to a component's internal state.
- **Stable Abstractions**: Designing interfaces (like APIs or event contracts) that can evolve without breaking consumers. This often involves separating the "what" (policy) from the "how" (mechanism).

### What “good” looks like

- Narrow surface area with coherent operations (do one thing well).
- Strong invariants at the boundary (validate early, fail fast with clear errors).
- Information hiding: consumers can’t rely on volatile details (schemas, vendors, file layout).
- Replaceable internals: swap storage/transport without consumer changes.
- Measurable contracts: latency/throughput envelopes and error modes are explicit.

## Patterns and pitfalls

- Favor system composition: Build systems from loosely coupled, well-bounded services or components, rather than monolithic architectures.
- Avoid distributed monoliths: Excessive inter-service dependencies or chatty communication patterns undermine encapsulation and increase fragility.
- Encapsulate what varies: Place boundaries around volatile or rapidly changing subsystems (e.g., vendor APIs, external data feeds, compliance modules).

Additional guidance

- Prefer seams at integration points: Use gateways, message brokers, or event buses to decouple domains and enable independent evolution.
- Don’t abstract the unproven: Let operational duplication persist until a clear need for a shared abstraction emerges at the system level.
- Use anti-corruption layers: When integrating with legacy or external systems, mediate interactions to protect your system’s model and contracts.

Common anti-patterns

- Leaky boundaries: Exposing internal data models, error codes, or operational details through public APIs or events.
- Anemic gateways: Pass-through proxies that do not enforce policy, validation, or observability at the system edge.
- Over-centralized control: Single points of failure or bottlenecks that violate the principle of distributed responsibility.

## When to use

- Distributed systems, microservices, and service-oriented architectures where independent evolution, resilience, and clear contracts are required.
- Platform boundaries, such as between internal systems and external partners, or between business domains.
- Any system where change isolation, compliance, or operational safety is a concern.

## When not to use

- Simple, single-purpose systems or prototypes where the cost of indirection and boundary management outweighs the benefits.
- Monolithic applications with tightly coupled logic that do not require independent deployment or scaling.

## Decision guide: introduce or tighten an abstraction?

<Figure caption="A decision flow for introducing or tightening an abstraction, based on factors like volatility, team boundaries, and complexity.">
```mermaid title="abstraction-decision-flow.mmd" showLineNumbers
flowchart TB
  A["Considering an abstraction?"] --> B{"Volatility likely? (vendor/schema/protocol)"}
  B -- Yes --> C{"Cross-team boundary exists?"}
  B -- No --> E{"Does it simplify mental load?"}
  C -- Yes --> D[Introduce or tighten abstraction]
  C -- No --> E
  E -- Yes --> D
  E -- No --> F[Delay; revisit after learning]
  D --> G[Define invariants, SLOs, and contract]
```
</Figure>

- Volatility: does the underlying choice change (vendors, schemas, protocols)?
- Cross-team boundary: will consumers integrate independently from implementers?
- Invariant strength: can we meaningfully enforce constraints at the boundary?
- Complexity: does a boundary simplify consumer mental load and testing?
- Observability: can we measure the boundary’s SLOs and error modes?

If “yes” to 3+ items, introduce or strengthen the abstraction.

## Encapsulation techniques (language-agnostic)

- Service boundaries: Encapsulate logic and data within services, exposing only well-defined APIs or event contracts.
- Network boundaries: Use gateways, firewalls, and service meshes to enforce access control and observability at system edges.
- Data encapsulation: Share data between systems via immutable events, APIs, or contracts—never direct database access.
- Policy enforcement: Centralize authentication, authorization, and validation at system boundaries, not within internal components.
- Operational isolation: Use separate deployment units, scaling policies, and failure domains to prevent cascading failures.

## Testing and verification

- End-to-end system tests: Validate that system boundaries enforce contracts, invariants, and error handling as expected.
- Contract testing: Ensure that APIs, events, and integration points remain compatible as systems evolve.
- Chaos engineering: Inject failures at the network, service, or infrastructure level to verify system resilience and encapsulation.
- Observability validation: Confirm that logs, metrics, and traces are emitted at boundaries and can be correlated across the system.

## Operational considerations

- SLOs: define facade-level latency bands (e.g., P95 ≤ 200ms) and success rate.
- Rollouts: hide provider swaps behind feature flags; use canaries; dual-write/read to validate.
- Limits: document payload ceilings, rate limits/quotas; enforce with backpressure.

## Security, privacy, and compliance

- Enforce authn/authz at the facade; prefer least-privilege to internals.
- Classify data (PII/PCI) crossing the boundary; scrub in logs and error payloads.
- Protect secrets in configuration; rotate credentials without consumer impact.

## Observability

- Include correlation IDs; add semantic logs at boundary with stable error codes.
- Expose metrics: request rate, success rate, P50/P95/P99 latency, saturation.
- Trace key steps across adapters; annotate provider choices for diagnosis.

## Edge cases and trade-offs

- Performance: Additional boundaries (gateways, brokers) can introduce latency and operational overhead; balance encapsulation with system efficiency.
- Debuggability: Encapsulation can obscure root causes; invest in distributed tracing and boundary-level logging.
- Consistency: System boundaries may require eventual consistency and careful contract management.
- Evolution: Keep integration layers and anti-corruption boundaries as thin as possible to ease future migrations or provider swaps.

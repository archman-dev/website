# Dataflow & Stream Processing

Dataflow programming is a paradigm that models a program as a directed graph of data flowing between operations. Stream processing applies this model to unbounded, continuous streams of data, treating data not as a static collection but as a series of events in motion. It's the foundation for real-time analytics, large-scale event processing, and reactive systems.

## Core ideas

- **Streams**: Unbounded, time-ordered sequences of immutable event records.
- **Operators**: Functions that transform streams. Common operators include `map`, `filter`, `join`, and `aggregate`.
- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: A pipeline is modeled as a DAG where streams are edges and operators are vertices.
- **Windowing**: Grouping infinite stream elements into finite "windows" based on time or count, allowing for aggregations over bounded sets.
- **State Management**: Many stream operations (like windowing or joins) are stateful. The system must provide fault-tolerant state storage.
- **Time Semantics**: Distinguishing between **Event Time** (when the event occurred at the source) and **Processing Time** (when the event is observed by the processing engine).

    subgraph "Windowed Aggregation"
        direction LR
        A[Start] --> B{For each event};
        B --> C["Calculate bucket timestamp"];
        C --> D["Construct bucket key"];
        D --> E["Add event value to bucket"];
        E --> B;
    end
```
</Figure>

## Examples

The examples show a simple, conceptual windowed aggregation. Real-world stream processors like Flink or Kafka Streams provide robust, fault-tolerant implementations of these concepts.

  E -- Yes --> F["Emit updated aggregate downstream"]
  E -- No --> G["Wait for more events or timer"]
  F --> H["Checkpoint state periodically"]

## Decision matrix (choosing a windowing strategy)

| Window type | Typical use | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tumbling | Periodic KPIs (e.g., 5‑min counts) | Simple, non‑overlapping | Boundary effects at window edges |
| Sliding | Rolling statistics | Smoother trends, more data points | Higher compute due to overlaps |
| Session | User activity bursts | Captures natural inactivity gaps | Requires tuning session gap; late data tricky |

  sections={[
    {

## Edge cases

- Late or out‑of‑order events: use watermarks and allowed lateness; route extreme lateness to side outputs.
- Hot keys/skew: shard keys (e.g., add random salt) and re‑aggregate; consider load‑aware partitioning.
- Large windows/state: enable incremental aggregation and compaction; set state TTLs.
- Exactly‑once sinks: prefer idempotent upserts and transactional/atomic writes where supported; avoid dual‑write hazards.

## Testing

- Deterministic window tests: feed synthetic, time‑stamped events (with reordering) and assert window outputs under configured watermarks.
- State recovery: crash between checkpoints and verify exactly‑once/at‑least‑once guarantees per design.
- Backpressure: simulate bursty sources and slow sinks; assert throughput and bounded latency within SLOs.
- Schema evolution: validate forward/backward compatibility via a registry (Avro/Protobuf) and consumer‑driven contracts.

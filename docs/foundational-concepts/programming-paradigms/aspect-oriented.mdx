# Aspect-Oriented Programming

> "Aspect-Oriented Programming is about modularizing things that would otherwise be scattered and tangled throughout your code."
> — Gregor Kiczales

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of **cross-cutting concerns**. These are functionalities like logging, authentication, or transaction management that "cut across" multiple points in an application's business logic. AOP provides mechanisms to define these concerns in one place (an "aspect") and apply them declaratively.

## Core ideas

- **Aspect**: A module that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern. For example, a `LoggingAspect` could contain all logging-related logic.
- **Join Point**: A specific point during the execution of a program, such as a method call or an exception being thrown. This is where an aspect *can* be applied.
- **Advice**: The action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Common advice types include `before`, `after`, and `around` (wrapping the join point).
- **Pointcut**: A predicate that matches join points. A pointcut expression (e.g., "all public methods in the `service` package") determines where advice is executed.
- **Weaving**: The process of linking aspects with the main application code. This can be done at compile time, load time, or runtime.

## Examples

Modern AOP is often implemented using decorators (in Python, TypeScript) or middleware/proxies (in Go, Java) which act as a lightweight form of runtime weaving.

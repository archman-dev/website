# Procedural / Structured

Procedural programming, enhanced by structured principles, is the bedrock of imperative coding. It organizes software into a linear sequence of procedures or functions that operate on data. By enforcing clear control flow constructs—sequence, selection (if/else), and iteration (loops)—it eliminates the chaotic "spaghetti code" of older, `goto`-based styles. This paradigm is direct, explicit, and highly effective for tasks with a clear, step-by-step process, making it a go-to for scripts, command-line tools, and foundational services.

**Scope and Boundaries**

Procedural/structured programming is foundational for all imperative languages and underpins many modern systems. It is best suited for workflows that are linear, predictable, and where state transitions are explicit and easy to follow. This paradigm is not intended for highly concurrent, event-driven, or stateful systems with complex object relationships—those are better addressed by [Object-Oriented](./object-oriented) or [Functional](./functional) paradigms. Here, we focus on the strengths, trade-offs, and operational realities of procedural/structured approaches.

> "The essence of structured programming is to control complexity through disciplined use of a few basic control structures and a process of stepwise refinement."

## Core Ideas

- **Modularity**: Break programs into reusable functions that perform a single, well-defined task. This enables easier testing, maintenance, and reuse.
- **Control Flow**: Use structured constructs (sequence, selection, iteration) to create clear, predictable execution paths. Avoid unstructured jumps (e.g., `goto`).
- **Data Flow**: Pass data explicitly through function parameters and return values to minimize side effects and global state.
- **Stepwise Refinement**: Decompose problems into smaller, manageable procedures, refining each step until the solution is clear and testable.
- **Explicit State**: State is managed through local variables and function arguments, not hidden in objects or closures.

**Real-World Scenarios:**

- **Batch Data Processing:** ETL jobs, log parsing, and data migration scripts are often written procedurally for clarity and reliability.
- **System Utilities:** Command-line tools, backup/restore scripts, and monitoring agents benefit from the directness of procedural flow.
- **Embedded Systems:** Many firmware and device drivers use procedural logic for deterministic control and resource efficiency.

## Testing strategy

- **Unit tests**: Validate each function (`validate`, `transform`, `call_gateway`/`callGateway`, `persist`) independently with happy paths and error cases.
- **Input validation**: Include table-driven tests for boundary values (zero/negative amounts, missing fields) to ensure failures are explicit and deterministic.
- **Contract tests**: If `call_gateway` talks to an external API, define a contract (fixtures/schemas) and verify both success and failure payloads to catch drift.
- **Integration tests**: Exercise `process_payment` end-to-end using test doubles for the gateway and persistence; assert idempotency on retries.
- **Observability assertions**: Verify that errors and key decisions emit structured logs/metrics for traceability.

## Edge cases and pitfalls

- **Global State:** Overuse of global variables can lead to hidden dependencies and bugs. Always prefer passing state explicitly.
- **Error Propagation:** Without a consistent error-handling strategy, failures may be silently ignored or mishandled.
- **Concurrency:** Procedural code is not inherently safe for concurrent execution; shared state must be protected or avoided.

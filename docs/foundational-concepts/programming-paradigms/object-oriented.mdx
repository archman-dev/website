# Object-Oriented Programming

> "The basic idea of object-oriented programming is this: we're going to hide the state, and we're going to expose functions that operate on that state."
> — Robert C. Martin

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a foundational paradigm for modeling software as a collection of collaborating objects, each encapsulating state and exposing behavior through methods. OOP is central to modern software engineering, enabling modularity, maintainability, and testability at scale. This article provides a comprehensive, end-to-end guide to OOP: its principles, trade-offs, real-world patterns, operational and security considerations, and practical implementation guidance. After reading, you will understand not only how OOP works, but when, why, and how to apply it for robust, production-grade systems.

## Scope and Boundaries

This article covers:

- Core OOP principles: encapsulation, composition, inheritance, polymorphism, dependency inversion
- Real-world design patterns and anti-patterns
- Practical code examples in Python, Go, and Node.js
- Decision models for when to use OOP (and when not to)
- Operational, security, and observability implications
- Design review checklist and related topics

Out of scope: deep dives into specific design patterns (see [Design Patterns](/docs/design-patterns)), language-specific OOP features, and advanced metaprogramming (see [Advanced Programming Concepts](/docs/foundational-concepts/programming-paradigms/functional)).

## Core Concepts

- **Encapsulation**: Internal state is hidden; only stable, public methods expose behavior.
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Prefer assembling small, focused objects over deep class hierarchies for flexibility and testability.
- **Polymorphism**: Program to interfaces or abstract types, enabling interchangeable components and plug-in architectures.
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations, decoupling system layers.
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism for code reuse, but should be used judiciously—favor composition for most cases.

<Figure caption="A dependency-inverted design for an order service, programming to the PaymentGateway interface.">
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentGateway {
        <<interface>>
        +authorize(amount: Money): AuthResult
    }
    class StripeGateway {
        +authorize(amount: Money): AuthResult
    }
    class OrderService {
        -gateway: PaymentGateway
        +place(order: Order): Receipt
    }
    PaymentGateway <|.. StripeGateway
    OrderService --> PaymentGateway
```
</Figure>

## OOP Call Flow Example (Order Placement)

<Figure caption="Order placement call flow: service delegates to gateway, handles errors, and returns result.">
```mermaid

    A["OrderService.place(order)"] --> B{"order.total_cents > 0?"}
    B --|No|--> C["Raise ValueError / error"]
    B --|Yes|--> D["gateway.authorize(order.total_cents)"]
    D --> E{"res.ok?"}
    E --|No|--> F["Raise payment failed error"]
    E --|Yes|--> G["Return PAID, auth_code"]
```

## Implementation Patterns, Pitfalls, and Anti-Patterns

- **Favor composition**: Use small, focused objects; avoid deep inheritance trees ([Composition Over Inheritance](/docs/core-design-and-programming-principles)).
- **Program to interfaces**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete types ([Dependency Inversion](/docs/core-design-and-programming-principles/solid)).
- **Enforce invariants**: Objects should always be valid after construction and during state transitions.
- **Avoid God Objects**: Do not centralize too much responsibility in a single class ([God Object](/docs/anti-patterns-and-pitfalls/god-object)).
- **Beware Anemic Domain Models**: Business logic should live in domain objects, not just in services ([Anemic Domain Model](/docs/anti-patterns-and-pitfalls/anemic-domain-model)).
- **Testability**: Inject dependencies to enable mocking and isolation in tests.
- **Immutability for value objects**: Use immutable types for things like Money, Email, etc.

## When to Use vs. When to Reconsider

    {
      label: "When to Use",
      points: [
        "**Modeling stable, stateful domains**: Excellent for systems with well-defined business entities (e.g., `Customer`, `Account`, `Policy`) that have both data and behavior.",
        "**Building complex, maintainable systems**: Encapsulation and clear boundaries help manage complexity in large applications like enterprise software or large-scale backend services.",
        "**Creating plug-in architectures**: Polymorphism allows you to define stable interfaces and swap out implementations, perfect for supporting different databases, payment gateways, or notification services.",

    {
      label: "When to Reconsider",

        "**High-concurrency data processing**: Managing state and locks can become a bottleneck. Functional or dataflow paradigms are often a better fit for parallel data pipelines.",
        "**Simple, stateless services**: The boilerplate of classes and interfaces can be overkill for simple functions or utilities that just transform data.",
        "**UI development with complex state**: Modern UI frameworks often favor functional and reactive patterns for managing UI state, which can be simpler than traditional object-oriented approaches.",
        "**Performance-critical, low-level code**: Sometimes, procedural or data-oriented design yields better performance and predictability."

## Design Review Checklist

<Checklist
  title="Design Review Checklist"
  items={[
    "Are dependencies injected and bound to interfaces, not concrete types?",
    "Is composition favored over deep or complex inheritance hierarchies?",
    "Do objects enforce their own invariants upon creation and during state transitions?",
    "Are responsibilities clearly segregated into small, cohesive classes (Single Responsibility Principle)?",
    "Can objects be easily tested in isolation by providing mock or stub dependencies?",
    "Are value objects immutable and used for domain concepts?",
    "Is there any evidence of God Objects or Anemic Domain Models?",
    "Are error and edge cases (empty/null, large input, concurrency) handled explicitly?",
    "Are security boundaries enforced via encapsulation and method-level validation?",
    "Are observability hooks (logs, metrics, traces) present for key state transitions?",
    "Is the design documented and cross-linked to related patterns and principles?"

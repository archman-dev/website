## What Is Architectural Decision Impact & Cost of Change?

Architectural decisions shape the system's long-term qualities. The later you reverse a high-impact choice, the more expensive it becomes. This page helps you identify high‑leverage decisions, assess reversibility, and reduce the cost of change with deliberate techniques.

- **Scope**: decision impact, reversibility, cost‑of‑change dynamics, mitigation techniques, and when to formalize decisions.
- **Out of scope**: stakeholder responsibilities and governance (see [Stakeholders & Concerns](./stakeholders-and-concerns)); level boundaries (see [Architecture vs. Design vs. Implementation](./architecture-vs-design-vs-implementation)).

## TL;DR

High-impact, hard-to-reverse decisions deserve prototypes, evidence, and staged rollouts; reversible, low-blast-radius choices should be decided quickly to preserve flow. Reduce the cost of change by designing seams, versioning contracts, and gathering evidence before committing.

### Learning objectives

- You will be able to assess decision impact and reversibility to calibrate rigor.
- You will be able to lower cost of change using seams, flags, and versioning.
- You will be able to structure ADRs and plan staged rollouts with guardrails.

### Motivating scenario

Your team must choose between keeping a shared database or moving to database‑per‑service. The change could touch contracts, data migration, and deployment. Using impact and reversibility as guides, you prototype critical paths, capture an ADR, and plan a canary rollout to keep option value while de‑risking the path forward.

## Core Concepts

| Concept         | What it means                                           | Why it matters                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Decision impact | The blast radius if the decision is wrong               | Guides formality and validation depth                            |
| Reversibility   | Ease of undoing or changing course                      | Drives urgency to prototype and the value of option preservation |
| Cost of change  | Effort, risk, and coordination required to change later | Typically rises with time and coupling                           |
| Option value    | Benefit of keeping alternatives open                    | Justifies modularity, seams, and incremental commitments         |
| Evidence loop   | Prototypes, benchmarks, and experiments                 | Reduces uncertainty before committing                            |

### Mental Models

Two useful mental models guide architectural decision-making:

- **One‑way vs two‑way doors**: one‑way are hard to reverse and deserve extra rigor; two‑way are revisitable and should be decided quickly to maintain flow.
- **Cost‑of‑change curve**: changes that span contracts, data, and deployments tend to get costlier as the system and organization evolve.

## Decision Flow

Use this flow to calibrate rigor and timing for architectural decisions.

<Figure caption="A flow for calibrating decision-making rigor based on impact, reversibility, and uncertainty.">
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A([Proposed decision]) --> B{"High blast radius?"};
    B -- Yes --> C{"Hard to reverse?"};
    B -- No --> D{"Low uncertainty?"};
    C -- Yes --> E["Prototype and measure"];
    C -- No --> F["Timebox experiment"];
    E --> G["Document ADR"];
    F --> G;
    D -- Yes --> H["Decide fast"];
    D -- No --> F;
    G --> I["Guardrails and rollout"];
    H --> I;
```
</Figure>

Practical cues:

- High blast radius examples: data model and storage choice, core API shapes, inter‑service communication style, region and failover posture.
- Hard to reverse examples: shared database between services, globally visible IDs or event shapes, authentication and token formats.

/>

## Patterns and Pitfalls

- Favor seams and adapters to isolate irreversible vendor/framework choices; avoid leaking vendor types across domain boundaries.
- Prefer versioned contracts for APIs/events; avoid “flag day” migrations and shared mutable models.
- Capture irreversible cross-team decisions with an ADR; avoid tribal knowledge in chat threads.
- Beware entangled rollouts (DB schema + protocol + UI all at once). Stage changes and use compatibility shims.
- Avoid over-engineering for hypothetical futures; invest in option value where signals justify it.

## Edge Cases

- Long-lived clients pinned to old contracts: support parallel versions and measure tail adoption before removal.
- Partial failures in async flows: ensure idempotency keys and dead-letter handling to prevent duplicate side effects.
- Data residency/sovereignty: region moves may require re-encryption/re-keying and legal review—treat as one-way doors.
- High-throughput hot paths: micro-optimizations can harden coupling; measure first and encapsulate optimizations behind interfaces.

<DecisionMatrix

  columns={["Impact", "Reversibility", "Uncertainty", "Recommended rigor"]}
  rows={[
    {
      name: "High impact × Low reversibility × High uncertainty",
      cells: ["High", "Low", "High", "Prototype + benchmark, ADR, review, canary"],
      highlightTone: "warning",
    },
    {

      cells: ["High", "Low", "Low", "ADR, staged rollout, guardrails"],
    },
    {
      name: "Medium impact × Medium reversibility × Medium uncertainty",
      cells: ["Medium", "Medium", "Medium", "Timeboxed spike, notes, lightweight review"],
    },
    {
      name: "Low impact × High reversibility × Low uncertainty",
      cells: ["Low", "High", "Low", "Decide fast; document in PR/issue"],
      highlightTone: "info",
    },
  ]}
/>

## When to Use Heavy Rigor (and When Not To)

- Use heavy rigor when impact is high, reversibility is low, or uncertainty is high (e.g., data model choices, inter-service protocols, region strategy).
- Use lightweight notes when impact is low and reversibility is high (e.g., library swaps behind stable interfaces). Optimize for flow.

### Signals & Anti-Signals

<ProsCons
  pros={[
    'Impact spans contracts/data/deployments',
    'Reversal requires multi-team coordination',
    'Uncertainty or novelty is high (performance/security unclear)',
  ]}
  cons={[
    'Change is isolated behind a stable interface seam',
    'Low blast radius with trivial rollback path',
    'Evidence already strong and uncertainty is low',
  ]}
/>

## When to Formalize with ADRs

Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for decisions that are any of: high blast radius, cross‑team impact, long‑lived constraints, regulated or risky. Keep entries short: context, decision, consequences, status. See the ADR materials:

- [ADR Index](../../documentation-and-modeling/architecture-decision-records-adr/)
- [Template & Rationale](../../documentation-and-modeling/architecture-decision-records-adr/template-and-rationale)
- [Catalog & Traceability](../../documentation-and-modeling/architecture-decision-records-adr/catalog-and-traceability)
- [Linking to Code & Docs](../../documentation-and-modeling/architecture-decision-records-adr/linking-to-code-and-docs)

### Lightweight Decisions

If a decision is low impact and reversible, prefer quick notes in issues or PRs over formal ADRs. Momentum is also a cost.

## Hands-On Exercise

Follow these steps to calibrate rigor and preserve options for a risky integration change.

1. Draft a quick hypothesis and risks for the decision (impact, reversibility, uncertainty).
2. Add a feature flag to route a small percentage of traffic to the new path.
3. Define rollback and observability guardrails (alerts, metrics, traces).
4. Capture an ADR summarizing context, decision, and consequences.

```md title="adr/0001-integration-choice.md" showLineNumbers
# Decision
Adopt PSP v2 behind a feature flag with staged rollout.

# Context
High potential impact across contracts and performance; reversibility is limited without a seam. Uncertainty around p95 latency.

# Consequences
Implement flag routing, benchmarks on hot paths, and canary rollout with rollback criteria. Version event contracts to avoid flag day.
```

### Example: Feature Flag to Preserve Options

<Figure caption="Sequential call flow for a feature-flagged payment authorization path.">

    A["HTTP request"] --> B["flags.isEnabled('psp_v2_enabled')"]
    B --> C{"Flag on?"}
    C -- Yes --> D["Use PSP v2 client"]
    C -- No --> E["Use PSP v1 client"]
    D --> F["client.authorize()"]
    E --> F
    F --> G{"Error?"}
    G -- Yes --> H["Rollback/circuit breaker"]
    G -- No --> I["Return 200 with result"]
```

    chosen = client(flag_on, psp_v1, psp_v2)
    result = chosen.authorize(request.json)
    return {"status": 200, "body": result}

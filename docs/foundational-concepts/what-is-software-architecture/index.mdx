# What Is Software Architecture

Software architecture is the set of high-impact design decisions that shape a system’s structure, boundaries, and evolution. It focuses on the choices that are hard to change, aligns technical direction with business goals, and sets the constraints within which teams build.

> "Architecture is about the important stuff—whatever that is." — Martin Fowler

In this section, you’ll:

- Distinguish architecture from design and implementation—and know when a choice becomes architectural
- Identify stakeholders and map their concerns to architectural views
- Understand decision records, trade‑offs, and how cost of change compounds over time

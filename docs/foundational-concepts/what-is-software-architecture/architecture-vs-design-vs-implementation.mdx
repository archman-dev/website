## What Is Architecture vs. Design vs. Implementation?

> "The architect's role is to balance the needs of the business, the constraints of the technology, and the art of the possible."
> — Grady Booch

This article clarifies the boundaries and handoffs between architecture, design, and implementation so teams make decisions at the right level and avoid rework.

**Scope**: definitions, responsibilities, decision types, and how to tell which level a decision belongs to. Includes examples, trade‑offs, and a quick decision flow.

**Out of scope**: deep analysis of change economics (see [Architectural Decision Impact & Cost of Change](./architectural-decision-impact-and-cost-of-change)), and stakeholder roles/process (see [Stakeholders & Concerns](./stakeholders-and-concerns)).

## TL;DR

Architecture sets long‑lived system boundaries and qualities; design shapes components and contracts to realize that architecture; implementation turns design into code and config. Place decisions by their blast radius and impact on quality attributes.

## Learning Objectives

You will be able to:

- **Classify decisions** as architecture, design, or implementation using clear criteria
- **Apply a decision flow** to choose the right level and artifact (ADR, contract, code)
- **Recognize cues and trade‑offs** that signal architectural significance
- **Plan operations, security, observability, and tests** appropriate to each level
- **Avoid common pitfalls** like design leakage and over-abstraction

## Motivating Scenario

Your team is building a checkout capability. Debates arise about database choices, API error formats, and retry policies. Using clear boundaries between architecture, design, and implementation helps you decide what must be stable and documented versus what can evolve locally in code.

**The challenge**: Without clear boundaries, teams either over-engineer simple decisions or under-document critical architectural choices, leading to technical debt and coordination overhead.

## Decision Flow

Use this mental model to place a decision at the right level.

<Figure caption="A decision flow for categorizing decisions and identifying next steps.">
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A([Decision]) --> B{"Affects system-wide qualities?"};
    B -- Yes --> C["Architecture level"];
    B -- No --> D{"Cross-cutting across many components?"};
    D -- Yes --> E["Design level"];
    D -- No --> F["Implementation level"];
    C --> C1["Capture ADR"];
    E --> E1["Define patterns and contracts"];
    F --> F1["Code, tests, configs"];
```
</Figure>

## Hands‑On Exercise

Follow these steps to practice placing decisions at the right level for your system.

1. Identify a pending decision (e.g., synchronous API vs. async messaging for order confirmation).
2. Run it through the decision flow above; note whether it affects system‑wide qualities.
3. Choose the artifact:
   - Architecture → capture an ADR with context, decision, consequences.
   - Design → update API contract, sequence diagram, or policy doc.
   - Implementation → change code and tests behind a feature flag.

## Self‑Check

1. Would reversing this decision change multiple services or quality attributes? If yes, it’s architectural.
2. Does this choice alter public interfaces or cross‑cutting policies? If yes, it’s design.
3. Can you change it locally with contained impact and tests? If yes, it’s implementation.

:::info
**One Takeaway**: Classify decisions by their blast radius and impact on quality attributes; let that dictate the artifact and rigor. Architecture decisions require ADRs and stakeholder review, design decisions need contracts and patterns, while implementation decisions can evolve through code reviews and tests.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I know if a decision is architectural versus design?**
A: Ask: "If I reverse this decision, does it require changing multiple services or affect system-wide quality attributes?" If yes, it's architectural. If it only affects interfaces or cross-cutting policies, it's design.

**Q: When should I write an ADR versus updating a contract or code?**
A: Write an ADR for architectural decisions that affect multiple teams or system qualities. Update contracts for design decisions that change public interfaces. Change code for implementation decisions with contained impact.

**Q: Can a decision start as implementation and become architectural?**
A: Yes, this happens when local choices create system-wide constraints. For example, choosing a specific database library might become architectural if it limits deployment options or creates vendor lock-in.

**Q: How do operations, security, observability, and testing differ by decision level?**
A: Architecture sets the overall strategy and SLOs, design defines component-level policies and contracts, and implementation handles specific tooling and configuration details.

### Example Artifacts (Abbreviated)

```yaml title="adr-0005-payment-integration.md (excerpt)" showLineNumbers
Status: Accepted
Context: External PSP has variable latency and failure modes.
Decision: Use async outbox + worker; PSP calls via circuit breaker; idempotency keys.
Consequences: Eventual consistency for payment status; simpler failure isolation.
```

```plaintext title="order-sequence.plain (simplified sequence)" showLineNumbers
Client -> API: POST /orders
API -> AppSvc: CreateOrder(cmd)
AppSvc -> Domain: Order.create()
Domain -> Outbox: enqueue(PaymentRequested)
Worker -> PSP: authorize()
PSP -> Worker: result
Worker -> Domain: apply(PaymentAuthorized|Failed)
```

<Figure caption="Call flow with retries and backoff for PSP authorization.">
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    S["Start"] --> A["Attempt 1..N"]
    A --> T["POST authorize()"]
    T -->|Success| R["Return result"]
    T -->|Error/Timeout| C{"More attempts left?"}
    C -- Yes --> B["Backoff with jitter"]
    B --> A
    C -- No --> E["Raise/propagate error"]
```
</Figure>

The following code examples demonstrate the implementation-level retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter. This is implementation because it can be changed locally without affecting the overall architecture or design contracts.

## Operational Considerations

The level of a decision directly impacts how it is operated, secured, and tested. Each level requires different approaches to monitoring, deployment, and maintenance.

      label: "Architecture Level",
      body: `**Trust Boundaries**: Define where authentication/authorization occurs and data classification policies.

      tone: "warning",
    },
    {
      label: "Design Level",
      body: `**API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and authorization policies for public interfaces.

**Vulnerability Scanning**: SAST/DAST tools and dependency scanning for known CVEs.

**Cryptographic APIs**: Correct usage of encryption libraries and key management.`,
      tone: "neutral",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Observability and Monitoring

  sections={[
    {
      label: "Architecture Level",
      body: `**Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request flow across services with correlation IDs.

      tone: "neutral",
    },
    {
      label: "Implementation Level",
      body: `**Trace Spans**: Detailed instrumentation of function calls and database queries.

**Log Statements**: Specific error messages and debug information.

**Custom Metrics**: Business-specific counters and gauges for application logic.`,
      tone: "positive",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Testing Strategies

      body: `**Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes with mocked dependencies.

**Property-Based Tests**: Generate test cases to verify invariants and edge cases.

**Mutation Testing**: Verify test quality by introducing code changes and checking test failure.`,
      tone: "positive",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Edge Cases and Anti-Patterns

**Decision Escalation**: Implementation choices can become architectural constraints over time. For example, choosing a specific ORM might limit database migration strategies, effectively becoming an architectural decision.

**Startup vs. Enterprise**: In early-stage companies, many "architectural" decisions are deferred and treated as design-level choices to accelerate delivery. The key is recognizing when a decision's impact grows beyond its original scope.

**Vendor Lock-in**: Library choices (implementation) can create vendor dependencies that become architectural constraints, limiting deployment options or requiring significant refactoring to change.

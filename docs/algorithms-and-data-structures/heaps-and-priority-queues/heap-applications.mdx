# Heap Applications

Practical applications of heap data structures for solving real-world problems.

## Top K elements

- **K Largest Elements**: Find k largest elements in array
- **K Smallest Elements**: Find k smallest elements in array
- **K Most Frequent**: Find k most frequent elements
- **K Closest Points**: Find k closest points to origin

## Median in data stream

- **Running Median**: Find median in stream of numbers
- **Two Heaps Approach**: Using min-heap and max-heap
- **Balanced Heaps**: Maintaining equal size heaps
- **Dynamic Median**: Updating median as new elements arrive

## Merge K sorted lists

- **Problem**: Merge k sorted linked lists into one
- **Heap Approach**: Using min-heap for efficient merging
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log k) where n is total elements
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) for heap storage

## Task scheduling

- **Priority Scheduling**: Schedule tasks based on priority
- **CPU Scheduling**: Round-robin with priority queues
- **Resource Allocation**: Managing shared resources
- **Deadline Scheduling**: Tasks with specific deadlines

## Shortest path (Dijkstra's)

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Find shortest path in weighted graph
- **Priority Queue**: Using heap for efficient vertex selection
- **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V) with binary heap
- **Applications**: Network routing, GPS navigation

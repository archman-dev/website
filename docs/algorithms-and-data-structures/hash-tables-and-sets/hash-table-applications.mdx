# Hash Table Applications

Hash tables are versatile data structures with numerous applications in algorithmic problem-solving.

## Frequency counting

- **Character Frequency**: Count occurrences of each character in string
- **Element Frequency**: Count occurrences of each element in array
- **Word Frequency**: Count word occurrences in text
- **Pattern Frequency**: Count pattern occurrences in data

## Lookup optimization

- **Fast Lookup**: O(1) average case for finding elements
- **Two Sum**: Finding pairs that sum to target
- **Complement Lookup**: Finding complement of current element
- **Index Mapping**: Mapping values to their indices

## Caching & memoization

- **Dynamic Programming**: Storing computed results to avoid recalculation
- **Function Memoization**: Caching function results
- **LRU Cache**: Least recently used cache implementation
- **Fibonacci Memoization**: Optimizing recursive calculations

## Grouping & categorization

- **Group Anagrams**: Grouping strings by their character frequencies
- **Group by Key**: Grouping elements by specific property
- **Partitioning**: Dividing data into categories
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar elements together

## Duplicate detection

- **Find Duplicates**: Identifying duplicate elements in array
- **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminating duplicate entries
- **First Duplicate**: Finding first occurrence of duplicate
- **Duplicate Count**: Counting number of duplicates

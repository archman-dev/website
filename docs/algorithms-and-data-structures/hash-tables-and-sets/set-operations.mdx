# Set Operations

Sets provide efficient operations for working with unique collections and mathematical set theory.

## Union, intersection, difference

- **Union**: Combine elements from two sets (A ∪ B)
- **Intersection**: Find common elements between sets (A ∩ B)
- **Difference**: Find elements in first set but not second (A - B)
- **Symmetric Difference**: Elements in either set but not both (A ⊕ B)

## Subset & superset problems

- **Subset Check**: Determine if one set is subset of another
- **Superset Check**: Determine if one set contains another
- **Proper Subset**: Subset that is not equal to parent set
- **Power Set**: Generate all possible subsets of a set

## Unique element problems

- **Find Unique**: Identify elements that appear only once
- **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminate duplicate elements
- **Unique Pairs**: Find unique pairs from two sets
- **Unique Combinations**: Generate unique combinations

## Set-based algorithms

- **Set Intersection**: Efficiently find common elements
- **Set Union**: Efficiently combine sets
- **Set Difference**: Efficiently find differences
- **Set Membership**: Quickly check if element exists

## Mathematical set problems

- **Cardinality**: Count number of elements in set
- **Cartesian Product**: Generate all ordered pairs
- **Set Partitioning**: Divide set into disjoint subsets
- **Set Covering**: Find minimum sets that cover universe

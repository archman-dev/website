# Deque & Priority Queue

Advanced queue data structures for specialized applications and optimizations.

## Double-ended queue operations

- **Deque Operations**: Add/remove from both ends
- **Front Operations**: Add/remove from front
- **Back Operations**: Add/remove from back
- **Efficient Implementation**: Using circular buffer or linked list

## Heap implementation

- **Min-Heap**: Parent is smaller than children
- **Max-Heap**: Parent is larger than children
- **Heap Operations**: Insert, extract, heapify
- **Array Representation**: Using array to represent heap

## Top K problems

- **Top K Elements**: Find k largest/smallest elements
- **Top K Frequent**: Find k most frequent elements
- **Top K Closest**: Find k closest points
- **Heap-based Solution**: Using heap for efficient solution

## Median finding

- **Running Median**: Find median in stream of numbers
- **Two Heaps**: Using min-heap and max-heap
- **Balanced Heaps**: Maintaining equal size heaps
- **Dynamic Median**: Updating median as new elements arrive

## Task prioritization

- **Priority Queue**: Tasks with different priorities
- **Heap-based Priority**: Using heap for priority queue
- **Dynamic Priorities**: Changing task priorities
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Priority-based scheduling

# Advanced Backtracking

Complex backtracking problems and advanced applications.

## Graph coloring

- **Problem**: Color graph vertices with minimum colors so no adjacent vertices have same color
- **Constraints**: No two adjacent vertices can have same color
- **Backtracking**: Try each color for vertex, backtrack if conflict
- **Optimization**: Use color classes and constraint propagation

## Hamiltonian cycle

- **Problem**: Find cycle that visits each vertex exactly once
- **Constraints**: Each vertex visited exactly once, cycle must be closed
- **Backtracking**: Build path incrementally, backtrack if dead end
- **Optimization**: Use pruning based on remaining vertices

## Knight's tour

- **Problem**: Find sequence of moves for knight to visit every square on chessboard
- **Constraints**: Knight must move in L-shape, visit each square once
- **Backtracking**: Try each possible move, backtrack if stuck
- **Optimization**: Use Warnsdorff's rule for better performance

## Partition problems

- **Problem**: Partition set into subsets with specific properties
- **Constraints**: Each element in exactly one subset, subsets satisfy conditions
- **Backtracking**: Try assigning each element to different subsets
- **Optimization**: Use dynamic programming for overlapping subproblems

## Constraint optimization

- **Problem**: Find solution that satisfies constraints and optimizes objective
- **Constraints**: Must satisfy all given constraints
- **Optimization**: Minimize or maximize objective function
- **Backtracking**: Explore solution space, prune based on objective bounds

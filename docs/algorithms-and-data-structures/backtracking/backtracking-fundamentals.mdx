# Backtracking Fundamentals

Essential concepts and techniques for implementing backtracking algorithms.

## Recursive exploration

- **Systematic Search**: Explore all possible solutions systematically
- **Decision Tree**: Represent problem as tree of decisions
- **Depth-First**: Explore each path completely before backtracking
- **State Space**: All possible states of the problem

## Pruning techniques

- **Constraint Pruning**: Eliminate branches that violate constraints
- **Bound Pruning**: Eliminate branches that cannot lead to better solution
- **Heuristic Pruning**: Use heuristics to guide search
- **Early Termination**: Stop when solution is found

## State space search

- **State Representation**: How to represent current state
- **State Transitions**: How to move from one state to another
- **Goal State**: Desired final state
- **Path Cost**: Cost of reaching current state

## Constraint satisfaction

- **Constraints**: Rules that must be satisfied
- **Variable Assignment**: Assigning values to variables
- **Constraint Propagation**: Inferring new constraints
- **Consistency Checking**: Verifying constraint satisfaction

## Solution space

- **Complete Solutions**: All variables assigned values
- **Partial Solutions**: Some variables assigned values
- **Solution Validation**: Checking if solution is valid
- **Solution Optimization**: Finding best solution among all valid solutions

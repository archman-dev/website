# Advanced Binary Search

Complex applications of binary search for solving optimization and search problems.

## Search in 2D matrix

- **Sorted 2D Matrix**: Search in matrix sorted row-wise and column-wise
- **Row-wise Sorted**: Matrix sorted only row-wise
- **Column-wise Sorted**: Matrix sorted only column-wise
- **Spiral Matrix**: Search in spiral-ordered matrix

## Search in infinite array

- **Unbounded Search**: Search in array of unknown size
- **Exponential Search**: Start with small range and double it
- **Binary Search on Range**: Apply binary search once range is found
- **Streaming Data**: Search in continuously growing data

## Peak finding

- **1D Peak**: Find peak element in 1D array
- **2D Peak**: Find peak element in 2D matrix
- **Local Peak**: Find any local maximum
- **Global Peak**: Find global maximum

## Square root & power

- **Square Root**: Find square root of number
- **Nth Root**: Find nth root of number
- **Power Function**: Implement power function efficiently
- **Modular Exponentiation**: Power with modular arithmetic

## Search with conditions

- **First True**: Find first element satisfying condition
- **Last False**: Find last element not satisfying condition
- **Custom Predicate**: Search with custom boolean function
- **Optimization Problems**: Find optimal value using binary search

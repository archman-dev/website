# Graph Fundamentals

Essential concepts and representations for working with graph data structures.

## Graph representation (adjacency list, matrix)

- **Adjacency List**: List of lists for each vertex
- **Adjacency Matrix**: 2D array representation
- **Edge List**: List of edges with weights
- **Incidence Matrix**: Matrix for vertices and edges

## Graph terminology

- **Vertex/Node**: Individual element in graph
- **Edge**: Connection between two vertices
- **Weight**: Cost or value associated with edge
- **Path**: Sequence of vertices connected by edges
- **Cycle**: Path that starts and ends at same vertex

## Graph traversal (DFS, BFS)

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explore as far as possible before backtracking
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explore all neighbors before moving to next level
- **Recursive DFS**: Using recursion for depth-first traversal
- **Iterative DFS**: Using stack for depth-first traversal

## Connected components

- **Connected Graph**: Path exists between any two vertices
- **Disconnected Graph**: Some vertices are not reachable
- **Strongly Connected**: Directed graph where all vertices are reachable
- **Weakly Connected**: Undirected version is connected

## Graph properties

- **Directed vs Undirected**: Direction of edges matters
- **Weighted vs Unweighted**: Edges have weights or not
- **Cyclic vs Acyclic**: Contains cycles or not
- **Dense vs Sparse**: Many or few edges relative to vertices

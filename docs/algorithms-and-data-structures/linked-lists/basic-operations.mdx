# Basic Operations

Essential operations for working with linked lists effectively.

## Traversal & manipulation

- **Linear Traversal**: Visit each node sequentially
- **Conditional Traversal**: Traverse based on specific conditions
- **Reverse Traversal**: Process nodes from end to beginning
- **Multi-pass Traversal**: Multiple iterations for complex operations

## Node insertion & deletion

- **Insertion**: Add new nodes at beginning, middle, or end
- **Deletion**: Remove nodes while maintaining list integrity
- **Position-based Operations**: Insert/delete at specific positions
- **Value-based Operations**: Insert/delete nodes with specific values

## List reversal

- **Iterative Reversal**: Reverse list using iterative approach
- **Recursive Reversal**: Reverse list using recursion
- **Partial Reversal**: Reverse specific portion of list
- **In-place Reversal**: Reverse without extra space

## Cycle detection

- **Floyd's Algorithm**: Detect cycle using fast and slow pointers
- **Cycle Length**: Find length of cycle if present
- **Cycle Start**: Find starting node of cycle
- **Cycle Removal**: Remove cycle from linked list

## List merging

- **Merge Two Sorted Lists**: Combine two sorted linked lists
- **Merge K Sorted Lists**: Merge multiple sorted lists
- **In-place Merging**: Merge without creating new list
- **Merge with Constraints**: Merge with specific requirements

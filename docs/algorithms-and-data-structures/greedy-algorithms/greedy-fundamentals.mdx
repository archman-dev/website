# Greedy Fundamentals

Essential concepts and principles for understanding and applying greedy algorithms.

## Greedy choice property

- **Definition**: Globally optimal solution can be reached by making locally optimal choice
- **Local Optimum**: Best choice at current step
- **Global Optimum**: Best overall solution
- **Irrevocable**: Once choice is made, it cannot be undone

## Optimal substructure

- **Definition**: Optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
- **Recursive Structure**: Problem can be broken down into smaller similar problems
- **Independence**: Subproblems are independent of each other
- **Combination**: Optimal solutions to subproblems combine to form optimal solution

## Proof techniques

- **Exchange Argument**: Show that any other solution can be improved
- **Cut and Paste**: Replace part of solution with greedy choice
- **Induction**: Prove by mathematical induction
- **Contradiction**: Assume non-greedy solution is optimal and derive contradiction

## When to use greedy

- **Greedy Choice Property**: Problem has greedy choice property
- **Optimal Substructure**: Problem has optimal substructure
- **No Backtracking**: Solution doesn't require backtracking
- **Local Optimum**: Local optimum leads to global optimum

## Common greedy patterns

- **Sorting First**: Sort input by some criteria
- **Selection**: Select elements based on greedy criteria
- **Interval Problems**: Handle intervals with greedy selection
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocate resources greedily

# Advanced Greedy

Complex greedy algorithm problems and advanced applications.

## Interval scheduling

- **Problem**: Schedule maximum number of non-overlapping intervals
- **Greedy Choice**: Select interval with earliest finish time
- **Variations**: Weighted intervals, multiple resources
- **Applications**: Resource allocation, task scheduling

## Set cover

- **Problem**: Find minimum number of sets that cover all elements
- **Greedy Choice**: Select set covering most uncovered elements
- **Approximation**: Greedy algorithm provides good approximation
- **Applications**: Facility location, network design

## Job scheduling

- **Problem**: Schedule jobs to minimize completion time or maximize profit
- **Greedy Choice**: Sort jobs by specific criteria
- **Variations**: Precedence constraints, multiple machines
- **Applications**: CPU scheduling, project management

## Resource allocation

- **Problem**: Allocate limited resources optimally
- **Greedy Choice**: Allocate to highest priority/benefit
- **Constraints**: Resource limits, fairness requirements
- **Applications**: Budget allocation, network bandwidth

## Optimization problems

- **Problem**: Find optimal solution under constraints
- **Greedy Choice**: Make locally optimal decision
- **Trade-offs**: Balance multiple objectives
- **Applications**: Portfolio optimization, route planning

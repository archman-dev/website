# Two Pointers

The two pointers technique is a powerful approach for solving array and string problems efficiently, often reducing time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n).

## Two sum variations

- **Two Sum**: Finding two numbers that add up to target
- **Three Sum**: Finding three numbers that add up to target
- **Four Sum**: Extending to four numbers
- **K Sum**: Generalizing to k numbers

## Container with most water

- **Problem**: Finding two lines that form container with maximum area
- **Approach**: Two pointers from both ends, move pointer with smaller height
- **Optimization**: Greedy approach with proof of correctness

## Remove duplicates

- **Sorted Array**: Remove duplicates from sorted array in-place
- **Unsorted Array**: Remove duplicates using hash set or sorting
- **Multiple Duplicates**: Handle cases with more than 2 duplicates
- **Return New Array**: Creating new array without duplicates

## Valid palindrome

- **String Palindrome**: Check if string reads same forwards and backwards
- **Alphanumeric Only**: Ignore non-alphanumeric characters
- **Case Insensitive**: Handle different cases
- **Palindrome Substring**: Find longest palindromic substring

## Merge sorted arrays

- **Two Sorted Arrays**: Merge two sorted arrays into one
- **In-place Merge**: Merge without extra space
- **K Sorted Arrays**: Merge multiple sorted arrays
- **Merge Sort**: Using merge operation in sorting algorithm

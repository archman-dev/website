# Sliding Window

The sliding window technique efficiently processes contiguous subarrays or substrings, often reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

## Fixed size window problems

- **Window Size K**: Process all subarrays of fixed size k
- **Maximum in Window**: Find maximum element in each window
- **Minimum in Window**: Find minimum element in each window
- **Average in Window**: Calculate average for each window

## Variable size window problems

- **Longest Subarray**: Find longest subarray satisfying condition
- **Shortest Subarray**: Find shortest subarray satisfying condition
- **Target Sum**: Find subarray with specific sum
- **Character Count**: Substring with specific character frequencies

## Maximum/minimum in window

- **Sliding Maximum**: Efficiently find maximum in each window
- **Sliding Minimum**: Efficiently find minimum in each window
- **Deque Approach**: Using double-ended queue for optimization
- **Monotonic Queue**: Maintaining monotonic property

## Substring problems

- **Longest Substring**: Without repeating characters
- **Shortest Substring**: Containing all characters of pattern
- **Anagram Substring**: Find all anagrams of pattern in string
- **Character Frequency**: Substrings with specific character counts

## Longest/shortest subarray

- **Longest Subarray**: With sum ≤ target
- **Shortest Subarray**: With sum ≥ target
- **Longest Subarray**: With at most k distinct elements
- **Shortest Subarray**: With at least k distinct elements

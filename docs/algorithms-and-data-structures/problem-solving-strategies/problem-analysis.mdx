# Problem Analysis

Systematic approach to understanding and breaking down algorithmic problems before implementation.

## Understanding requirements

- **Read Carefully**: Understand input/output format and constraints
- **Identify Key Information**: Extract important details and edge cases
- **Clarify Ambiguities**: Ask questions about unclear requirements
- **Examples**: Work through provided examples to understand expected behavior

## Identifying patterns

- **Data Structure Patterns**: Recognize when to use arrays, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithm Patterns**: Identify common algorithmic approaches (DP, greedy, etc.)
- **Problem Categories**: Classify problems by type (search, optimization, etc.)
- **Similar Problems**: Connect to previously solved similar problems

## Choosing data structures

- **Access Patterns**: Consider how data will be accessed (random, sequential)
- **Operations**: Identify required operations (insert, delete, search, update)
- **Constraints**: Consider memory and time constraints
- **Trade-offs**: Balance between time and space complexity

## Time/space tradeoffs

- **Time vs Space**: Understand when to optimize for time vs space
- **Preprocessing**: Consider preprocessing data for faster queries
- **Caching**: Use memoization or caching for repeated calculations
- **Approximation**: Consider approximate solutions for better performance

## Edge case handling

- **Empty Input**: Handle empty arrays, strings, or null inputs
- **Single Element**: Consider arrays/strings with one element
- **Boundary Values**: Handle minimum and maximum possible values
- **Invalid Input**: Handle malformed or unexpected input formats

# Interview Preparation

Strategies and techniques for succeeding in technical interviews and coding assessments.

## Common question patterns

- **Array/String Manipulation**: Two pointers, sliding window, string processing
- **Tree/Graph Traversal**: DFS, BFS, tree construction, path finding
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization problems with overlapping subproblems
- **Hash Table Problems**: Frequency counting, lookup optimization
- **Sorting/Searching**: Binary search, custom sorting, search optimization

## Time management

- **Problem Understanding**: Spend 5-10 minutes understanding the problem
- **Solution Design**: Spend 10-15 minutes designing the approach
- **Implementation**: Spend 20-30 minutes coding the solution
- **Testing**: Spend 5-10 minutes testing and debugging
- **Optimization**: Use remaining time for optimization if needed

## Communication skills

- **Think Aloud**: Explain your thought process while solving
- **Ask Questions**: Clarify requirements and constraints
- **Explain Approach**: Describe your algorithm before coding
- **Discuss Trade-offs**: Explain time/space complexity trade-offs
- **Handle Feedback**: Respond constructively to interviewer feedback

## Code review

- **Code Quality**: Write clean, readable, and well-structured code
- **Edge Cases**: Consider and handle edge cases appropriately
- **Efficiency**: Implement efficient solutions with good complexity
- **Testing**: Test your solution with various inputs
- **Documentation**: Add comments for complex logic

## Follow-up questions

- **Scalability**: How would you handle larger inputs?
- **Extensions**: How would you modify for different requirements?
- **Optimization**: Can you improve time or space complexity?
- **Real-world**: How would you apply this in a real system?
- **Alternatives**: What other approaches could you consider?

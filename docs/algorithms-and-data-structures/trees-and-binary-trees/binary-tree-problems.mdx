# Binary Tree Problems

Common algorithmic problems involving binary trees and their solutions.

## Path sum problems

- **Path Sum**: Check if tree has root-to-leaf path with given sum
- **Path Sum II**: Find all root-to-leaf paths with given sum
- **Path Sum III**: Count paths with given sum (path can start/end anywhere)
- **Maximum Path Sum**: Find maximum sum of any path in tree

## Tree diameter & width

- **Tree Diameter**: Length of longest path between any two nodes
- **Tree Width**: Maximum number of nodes at any level
- **Binary Tree Width**: Width of binary tree at each level
- **Maximum Width**: Find maximum width of binary tree

## Lowest common ancestor

- **LCA in Binary Tree**: Find lowest common ancestor of two nodes
- **LCA in BST**: Optimized LCA for binary search trees
- **LCA with Parent Pointers**: Using parent pointers for LCA
- **Distance between Nodes**: Using LCA to find distance

## Tree views (left, right, top, bottom)

- **Left View**: Nodes visible from left side of tree
- **Right View**: Nodes visible from right side of tree
- **Top View**: Nodes visible from top of tree
- **Bottom View**: Nodes visible from bottom of tree

## Tree transformation

- **Invert Binary Tree**: Swap left and right children of all nodes
- **Flatten Binary Tree**: Convert tree to linked list
- **Tree to Array**: Convert tree to array representation
- **Mirror Tree**: Create mirror image of binary tree

# Tree Fundamentals

Essential concepts and operations for working with tree data structures.

## Tree terminology & properties

- **Node**: Individual element in tree with data and references to children
- **Root**: Top node with no parent
- **Leaf**: Node with no children
- **Height**: Length of longest path from root to leaf
- **Depth**: Length of path from root to specific node
- **Subtree**: Tree formed by node and all its descendants

## Tree traversal (pre, in, post, level)

- **Pre-order**: Process root, then left subtree, then right subtree
- **In-order**: Process left subtree, then root, then right subtree
- **Post-order**: Process left subtree, then right subtree, then root
- **Level-order**: Process nodes level by level (BFS)

## Tree construction & validation

- **Construction**: Building tree from array, string, or other representation
- **Validation**: Checking if tree satisfies certain properties
- **Balanced Trees**: Ensuring tree height is logarithmic
- **Complete Trees**: Trees where all levels are filled except possibly last

## Tree height & depth

- **Height Calculation**: Recursive approach to find maximum depth
- **Depth Calculation**: Distance from root to specific node
- **Balanced Height**: Ensuring height difference between subtrees is minimal
- **Height-based Operations**: Using height for tree balancing and optimization

## Tree serialization

- **Serialization**: Converting tree to string or array representation
- **Deserialization**: Reconstructing tree from serialized format
- **Format Choices**: Pre-order, level-order, or custom formats
- **Handling Nulls**: Representing missing nodes in serialized form

## TL;DR

Threat modeling is a disciplined approach to identifying security vulnerabilities before systems are deployed. This template uses the STRIDE methodology to systematically examine spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege threats. Threat models should be completed early in design and revisited when architecture changes.

## Learning Objectives

After completing a threat model using this template, you will be able to:

- Identify critical assets and data flows
- Enumerate threats using the STRIDE framework
- Assess threat likelihood and impact
- Develop mitigation strategies
- Create and maintain a risk register
- Communicate security concerns to stakeholders

### 4. STRIDE Threat Enumeration

<Tabs>

### 5. Risk Scoring Matrix

For each identified threat, assign scores:

**Likelihood Score** (1-5):
- 1: Very unlikely, sophisticated attack required
- 2: Unlikely, requires specific conditions
- 3: Possible, but would require some effort
- 4: Likely, easily exploitable vulnerability
- 5: Very likely, common attack pattern

**Impact Score** (1-5):
- 1: Minimal (cosmetic issue, no data loss)
- 2: Low (limited data exposure, minor functionality loss)
- 3: Medium (significant data exposure, major feature unavailable)
- 4: High (widespread data compromise, system unavailable)
- 5: Critical (compliance violation, legal liability, full compromise)

**Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Risk | Priority |
|--------|-----------|--------|------|----------|
| Spoofing user identity via weak auth | 4 | 5 | 20 | Critical |
| Payment tampering in transit | 2 | 5 | 10 | High |
| Unauthorized admin access | 3 | 4 | 12 | High |
| DoS attack on payment endpoint | 4 | 3 | 12 | High |
| Information disclosure in logs | 3 | 3 | 9 | Medium |

### 6. Mitigation Strategies

For each high-risk threat, develop mitigations:

<Showcase title="Threat Mitigation Template">

**Threat**: Spoofing user identity through weak password requirements

**Current State**: System allows short passwords without complexity requirements

**Risk Level**: Critical (Likelihood: 4, Impact: 5)

**Mitigation Option 1: MFA Implementation**
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Require SMS, authenticator app, or hardware token
- Effort: High | Cost: Medium | Effectiveness: Very High

**Mitigation Option 2: Password Policy Enforcement**
- Enforce minimum 12-character passwords
- Require complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Implement password history and expiration
- Effort: Medium | Cost: Low | Effectiveness: Medium

**Mitigation Option 3: Passwordless Authentication**
- Implement passkey/WebAuthn authentication
- Allow platform-native authentication (biometric, device unlock)
- Effort: Very High | Cost: Medium | Effectiveness: Very High

**Recommendation**: Implement MFA first (high effectiveness, reasonable effort), plan for passwordless authentication in next quarter.

**Responsible Party**: Security Team
**Target Implementation Date**: 2025-05-01
**Verification Method**: Penetration testing, user access verification

</Showcase>

### 7. Mitigation Tracking

<Checklist items={[
  "For Each Mitigation",
  "Responsible owner and team",
  "Target implementation date",
  "Implementation status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)",
  "Verification method (testing, audit, code review)",
  "Residual risk after mitigation",
  "Risk Register",
  "Track mitigation progress",
  "Update when architecture changes",
  "Review quarterly or when risks change",
  "Acceptance Criteria",
  "No new vulnerabilities introduced",
  "Performance impact is acceptable",
  "User experience is not negatively affected",
  "Compliance requirements are met"
]} />

## Common Threat Modeling Mistakes

<Showcase title="Mistakes to Avoid">

**Threat modeling too late**: Conducting threat modeling after development has begun makes remediation costly. Threat model during architecture phase.

**Focusing only on external attackers**: Don't forget insider threats and accidental misconfigurations. Consider all threat actors.

**Ignoring low-likelihood, high-impact threats**: Critical risks with low probability can still warrant mitigation. Assess impact carefully.

**Treating mitigation as complete**: Security is ongoing. Threats evolve, new vulnerabilities are discovered. Review threat models regularly.

**Lack of implementation accountability**: Good threat models fail without clear ownership. Assign specific people responsible for each mitigation.

**Missing supply chain threats**: Third-party libraries, cloud services, and external APIs introduce threats. Include them in threat modeling.

## Self-Check

Before finalizing your threat model, verify:

- All critical assets have been identified
- Trust boundaries are clearly defined
- STRIDE analysis has been applied systematically
- Top 10 risks have been scored and ranked
- High-risk threats have mitigation strategies
- Mitigations have clear ownership and timelines
- Residual risk is documented and accepted
- Plan for periodic review is established

## One Takeaway

:::info One Takeaway
Threat modeling is not a one-time activity but an ongoing conversation about security. The best threat models are created by diverse teams, revisited when systems change, and treated as living documents that guide security decisions throughout the system lifecycle.

:::

## Next Steps

1. **Schedule threat modeling session** with cross-functional team
2. **Create initial data flow diagrams** to understand system architecture
3. **Apply STRIDE framework** to identify threats
4. **Score and prioritize** the most critical risks
5. **Develop mitigation strategy** and assign ownership
6. **Establish quarterly reviews** to keep threat model current

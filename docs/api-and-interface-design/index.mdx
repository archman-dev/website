## Overview

Modern systems are defined by their interfaces. Whether you're building REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, gRPC services, or webhook systems, thoughtful interface design determines whether developers can integrate quickly or struggle for weeks.

This section explores the principles and practices for designing APIs that:
- **Scale with growth** while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Integrate easily** with clear contracts and comprehensive documentation
- **Secure sensitive data** through authentication and authorization strategies
- **Enable discovery** through intuitive resource design and versioning
- **Support evolution** without breaking existing consumers

### Key Areas Covered

- **RESTful API Design**: HTTP-first interfaces with resources, representations, and hypermedia
- **GraphQL**: Query language approach to flexible data fetching
- **gRPC/RPC**: High-performance binary protocols for internal communication
- **AsyncAPI**: Event-driven and async communication patterns
- **Versioning Strategies**: Managing breaking changes and deprecation
- **API Security**: Authentication, authorization, scopes, and threat modeling
- **Webhooks**: Pushing data to external systems reliably
- **API Governance**: Standardization, lifecycle management, and API-first practices

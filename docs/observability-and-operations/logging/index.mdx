# Logging

Logs are your system's narrative: what happened, when it happened, and the state at that moment. Unlike metrics (which aggregate) and traces (which follow requests), logs capture fine-grained events in sequence, often with rich context.

Good logging discipline enables:

- **Troubleshooting**: Quickly understand what went wrong in production
- **Compliance**: Maintain audit trails for security and regulatory requirements
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify slow operations and bottlenecks
- **Alerting**: Trigger on error patterns or anomalies
- **Business Intelligence**: Extract insights from application events

But logging has costs: storage, ingestion, and retention. Unstructured logs create signal-to-noise problems. This section covers logging as a practice: structuring logs for queryability, managing log levels, controlling retention, and protecting sensitive data.

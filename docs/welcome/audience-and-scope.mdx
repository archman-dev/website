## Who this is for

This handbook is designed for technical professionals across multiple disciplines and career levels:

- **Backend engineers** learning system design, distributed systems, and operational excellence
- **Frontend developers** building scalable applications, design systems, and frontend architectures
- **Full-stack engineers** connecting frontend and backend concerns across the stack
- **Architects** designing systems, organizing teams, and making trade-offs
- **Tech leads** balancing code quality, team velocity, and long-term vision
- **Engineering managers** understanding technical decisions and team structure implications
- **Platform engineers** building infrastructure, standards, and internal tooling
- **Students & career changers** building foundational architecture knowledge
- **SREs & DevOps engineers** learning distributed systems, reliability, and operations

The material spans **beginner through advanced** levels. You can start wherever matches your experience and goals.

## What it covers

This handbook organizes software architecture across **24 major sections**, from foundations to governance:

**Foundations & Principles**
- Foundational concepts, design principles, and quality attributes
- How trade-offs shape every architectural decision

**Patterns & Design**
- Proven design patterns and architectural styles
- When to apply each pattern and common pitfalls

**Distributed Systems**
- Microservices, resilience, communication, and data consistency
- Handling failures, consistency models, and service coordination

**Data & Persistence**
- Data architecture, storage models, and query patterns
- Caching, indexing, and performance optimization

**Cloud & Operations**
- Cloud-native topology, container orchestration, and networking
- Compute models, networking, and platform concerns

**API & Interface Design**
- RESTful APIs, gRPC, GraphQL, and webhooks
- Versioning, error handling, and governance

**Frontend & Mobile**
- Frontend architecture, state management, and performance
- Mobile-specific concerns: offline sync, battery, network constraints

**Testing & Delivery**
- Testing strategy, continuous delivery, and release engineering
- Infrastructure as code and deployment patterns

**Observability & Governance**
- Logging, metrics, tracing, and SLOs
- Architecture governance and compliance

**Specialized Domains**
- E-commerce, FinTech, social platforms, real-time systems, ML, IoT, and more

## What it doesn't cover

To stay focused on architecture, this handbook explicitly excludes:

- **Framework-specific tutorials** (React, Django, Spring Boot tutorials belong elsewhere)
- **Vendor-specific implementations** (AWS Lambda deep-dives, Google Cloud-only guides)
- **Emerging tools** (focuses on concepts that outlast any single technology)
- **Pure DevOps tooling** (Kubernetes operators, Terraform modules in detail)
- **Mathematical proofs** (consensus algorithms at a conceptual, not formal level)
- **Historical deep-dives** (context where relevant; academic history is minimal)

Instead, the focus is on **concepts, trade-offs, and decision-making** that apply across technology choices.

## Skill levels addressed

Each article is labeled with a difficulty:

| Level | When to start | Expectation |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **intro** | Everyone | High-level concepts; no prerequisites beyond prerequisites page |
| **intermediate** | After foundational concepts | Deeper patterns; hands-on examples; some system design knowledge |
| **advanced** | After architectural styles | Nuanced trade-offs; complex scenarios; production constraints |

Start at **intro** and progress as your confidence grows. You don't have to read sequentially—jump to topics matching your immediate needs.

## How to get the most from this handbook

**1. Pick your learning path**
- See [Learning Order](./learning-order) for recommended sequences
- Or jump to a domain-specific path (e.g., FinTech, E-Commerce) from the Welcome index

**2. Understand notation**
- Read [Notation & Cross-References](./notation-and-cross-references) to decode diagrams, code tabs, and difficulty labels

**3. Use cross-references**
- Review [Cross-References](./cross-references) to understand how sections connect
- Each article links related material; follow connections that match your goals

**4. Engage actively**
- Sketch diagrams as you read
- Ask "what would happen if..." for each pattern
- Apply examples to a system you know

**5. Come back often**
- Bookmark sections you find valuable
- Return to refresh concepts as you encounter them in practice
- Share sections with your team for discussion

## Estimation & commitment

Each article is tagged with an **estimated reading time** (5–15 minutes for intro/intermediate; up to 30 for advanced). This includes skimming examples but not deep code exploration.

A full read-through of all sections would take 40–60 hours. That's not the goal. Instead:

- Spend **5–10 hours** building a solid foundation (Welcome → Foundational Concepts → Design Principles)
- Spend **2–3 hours per week** going deeper on topics relevant to your current projects
- Revisit sections every few months as your perspective matures

## Takeaway

This handbook is a **practical companion**, not a textbook to memorize. It's meant to be referenced, discussed with your team, and applied to real decisions. Your career level, role, and goals shape how you navigate it—there's no single "right" order, but your growth matters most.

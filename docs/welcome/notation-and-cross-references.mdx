## Page components

Each article uses consistent visual components to convey information:

### Hero
A large, visually prominent introduction at the top of most pages. It sets context and signals the article's main topic.

### Figure
Diagrams, screenshots, and illustrations throughout the text. Figures are captioned and help explain concepts visually. Most are Mermaid diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state machines).

### Callout boxes
Short highlighted sections for emphasis:

- **ℹ️ Info:** Additional context or a tip to deepen understanding
- **✅ Success / Pro:** Recommended approach or best practice
- **⚠️ Warning:** Common pitfall or important caution
- **❌ Danger:** Avoid this; high-risk pattern
- **💡 Takeaway:** Key insight to remember

### Tabs
Code examples in multiple languages (Python, Go, Node.js) or to compare approaches. Click to switch between options.

### Showcase
Side-by-side comparison boxes to contrast two approaches (good vs. risky, or framework A vs. framework B).

### Vs
A two-column comparison of contrasting concepts (e.g., REST vs. GraphQL, monolith vs. microservices).

### Checklist
Interactive checkboxes for validation lists, readiness checks, or task guides.

### ProsCons
Organized comparison of advantages and disadvantages for decision-making.

## Metadata & tags

Every article includes:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **sidebar_position** | Order in the section (lower = earlier in nav) |
| **difficulty** | intro, intermediate, or advanced |
| **estimatedTime** | Reading time in minutes |
| **docType** | guide (procedural), concept (explanation), reference (lookup), or architecture (deep-dive) |
| **keywords** | Search terms for discoverability |
| **tags** | Category labels (e.g., "resilience", "performance") |
| **lastReviewed** | When the article was last fact-checked |

## Difficulty levels

Each article is tagged with a difficulty. This tells you what prior knowledge is expected:

| Level | When to read | Prerequisites |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **intro** | First time on a topic | [Prerequisites](/docs/welcome/prerequisites) page covers it |
| **intermediate** | After reading intro-level sections in the area | Prior "intro" articles from the same section |
| **advanced** | Deep dive with nuance | Prior "intro" and "intermediate" articles; comfort with trade-offs |

Start at **intro** for unfamiliar topics. Progress only when concepts feel solid.

## Document types

Each article is marked with a **docType**:

| Type | Purpose | How to use |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **guide** | Step-by-step or sequential explanation | Read top-to-bottom for learning |
| **concept** | Explanation of a core idea or pattern | Read to understand; reference as needed |
| **reference** | Lookup information, quick answers | Skim for your specific question |
| **architecture** | Deep-dive design patterns or systems | Read carefully; great for team discussion |

## Diagrams & Mermaid

Most diagrams in this handbook are **Mermaid** (text-based, version-controlled). You'll see:

- **Flowcharts (TB / LR):** Show process flow or decision logic
- **Sequence diagrams:** Illustrate interactions over time (client-server, distributed calls)
- **State machines:** Model state transitions and triggers
- **Class diagrams:** Show relationships between concepts
- **Gitgraph:** Illustrate branching patterns in deployment or version control

All Mermaid diagrams are readable even if rendering fails; the text explains them.

## Code examples

Code samples appear in a few styles:

### Pseudocode
Language-agnostic high-level code illustrating concepts, not production code. Looks like:
```
if request.timeout < system.elapsed:
  throw TimeoutError
```

### Multi-language tabs
Practical examples in Python, Go, or Node.js. Click tabs to switch. These show real patterns you can adapt.

### YAML / Configuration
Infrastructure, deployment, or configuration examples (e.g., Kubernetes manifests, CI/CD pipeline configs).

## Cross-reference conventions

### Internal links
Links to other handbook sections use shorthand:
- `[Foundational Concepts](/docs/foundational-concepts)` → Link to another section
- Relative links like `../testing-strategy` refer to sibling sections

### External links
Links to external resources end with **↗️** and open in a new tab:
- `[The Twelve-Factor App ↗️](https://12factor.net/)`

### Section index cards
Many sections end with a visual index of sub-topics. Click any to jump to that article.

## Reading strategies

**Linear reader?** Start at [Learning Order](./learning-order), pick your tier, and move sequentially.

**Jump around?** Use [Cross-References](./cross-references) to find related articles. The table shows common "if you're reading X, also see Y" connections.

**Team learner?** Read an article, then discuss the trade-offs with your team. Share sections using the browser's "Copy Link" feature.

**Reference seeker?** Bookmark sections you return to often. Use browser search (Ctrl+F / Cmd+F) to find concepts within articles.

## Notation summary

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| 📝 | Example or illustration |
| ↗️ | External link (new tab) |
| **bold** | Key term or important phrase |
| `code` | Technical term, variable, or command |
| `> quote` | Emphasized or quoted insight |
| ❌ ✅ | Anti-pattern vs. best practice |
| **Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.** | Learning progression level |

## Takeaway

This handbook is designed to be **scannable, searchable, and referenceable**. Use the components, metadata, and cross-references to navigate in whatever way suits your learning style. If something is unclear, check [Cross-References](./cross-references) to see related articles that might provide context.

Now that you know how to read this handbook, head to [Learning Order](./learning-order) or [Audience & Scope](./audience-and-scope) to find your starting point.

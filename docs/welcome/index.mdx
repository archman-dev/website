# Welcome

This manual is a practical companion for architects and engineers. Start here to learn how it’s organized, who it’s for, and how to pick a learning path that fits your goals and experience.

## How to use this manual

- Skim this page and the Prerequisites to get oriented.
- Choose a learning path that matches your role and needs (see below). Each path builds knowledge progressively from fundamentals → patterns → architecture → operations → governance.
- Dip in as a reference during design work, reviews, and incident analysis. Most sections are concise with pointers to deeper areas.

:::tip Role‑based quick starts

- New to architecture: start with the Quick Start path below, then choose a path.
- API/platform/SRE focus: prioritize resilience and observability topics after a quick read of Foundations.
- Leadership: focus on governance, ADRs, and review checklists, then skim System Design.

## Choose your path

Pick a sequence that fits your goals. Items marked as “coming soon” are planned but not published yet.

:::info 0️⃣ Quick Start (new to architecture)

- Foundations → Programming Patterns → System Design
- Add Testing & Observability once you start shipping
- Light intro to Security early to build good habits
  :::

:::tip 1️⃣ Software Engineer → Senior/Architect

- Architecture Foundations → Programming Patterns → Architectural Patterns → System Design → Testing & Observability → Security Architecture (some areas may be coming soon)
  :::

:::success 2️⃣ Frontend → Frontend/Full‑Stack Architect

- Foundations → Frontend Architecture (components, state, SSR/SSG) → System Design (APIs, caching, edge/CDN) → Testing & Observability (UX metrics/Core Web Vitals) → Security (CORS, OAuth flows)
- Micro‑frontends and design systems (coming soon)
  :::

:::info 3️⃣ Backend Engineer → Platform/Infrastructure

- System Design → Cloud Platforms → Testing & Observability → Security Architecture → Architectural Patterns (coming soon)
- Service mesh, multi‑tenancy, and cost controls (coming soon)
  :::

:::tip 4️⃣ API Designer → API Platform Lead

- REST fundamentals → Error models & versioning → gRPC/GraphQL trade‑offs → API Gateway & governance → Webhooks & async contracts → Testing (CDC)
- API style guides and linting (coming soon)
  :::

:::success 5️⃣ SRE/DevOps → Reliability Architect

- Observability (logs/metrics/traces, SLOs) → Resilience patterns (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers) → Performance & capacity → Delivery (CI/CD, canary/blue‑green) → Incident response & chaos engineering
- Error budgets and toil reduction playbooks (coming soon)
  :::

:::info 6️⃣ Data Engineer → Data Architect

- Programming Patterns → Data Architecture (modeling, consistency) → System Design (throughput, storage) → Cloud data platforms → Testing & Observability (data quality)
- Streaming, CDC, and feature stores (coming soon)
  :::

:::tip 7️⃣ Event‑Driven & Streaming Systems

- Event‑driven architecture → Messaging patterns → CQRS → Sagas → Event sourcing → Observability for streams (lag, DLQs)
- Exactly‑once pragmatics and replay strategies (coming soon)
  :::

:::success 8️⃣ Mobile Engineer → Mobile Architect

- Foundations → Mobile architecture (MVVM/Clean) → Offline sync & conflict resolution → API & contract design for mobile → Release & observability
- Background tasks, battery/network constraints (coming soon)
  :::

:::info 9️⃣ ML Engineer → ML Systems Architect

- Data pipelines → Model serving patterns → Observability (drift, quality) → Feature stores → Security & governance for ML
- Reproducibility, lineage, and deployment strategies (coming soon)
  :::

:::warning 1️⃣0️⃣ High‑Compliance/Enterprise Architect

- Governance & risk → Security Architecture (IAM, encryption, key mgmt) → Auditability → Data residency → Platform controls & policy as code
- Regulatory mappings and evidence collection (coming soon)
  :::

:::caution 1️⃣1️⃣ Modernization Leader (Monolith → Modular/Microservices)

- Capability mapping & DDD → Strangler Fig → Branch‑by‑abstraction → Zero‑downtime schema migration → Observability & release strategies
- Legacy encapsulation and ACL patterns (coming soon)
  :::

:::warning 1️⃣2️⃣ Startup/Small Team Path

- Architecture Foundations → System Design → Cloud Platforms → Security Architecture → Testing & Observability (coming soon)
- Bias toward managed services and cost efficiency
  :::

:::danger 1️⃣3️⃣ Security‑Focused Career Path

- Architecture Foundations → Security Architecture → System Design → Cloud Platforms → Testing & Observability (coming soon)
- Threat modeling, zero trust, secrets management
  :::

Tip: If you have an immediate problem (e.g., resilience, data consistency, observability), jump directly to that area, then circle back to the foundations to solidify your decision-making.

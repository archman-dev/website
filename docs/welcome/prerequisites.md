# Prerequisites

You don’t need advanced math or a specific tech stack. These basics will help you get the most value:

## Required

- Basic programming experience and ability to read pseudocode
- Familiarity with OS and networking fundamentals (processes, ports, DNS, HTTP)
- Version control basics (Git branching, pull requests)

## Helpful

- Some exposure to client–server or distributed systems
- Comfort reading simple diagrams (C4/UML sequence)
- Access to a cloud account or local container runtime for experiments (optional)

## Quick setup (optional but handy)

- Node.js LTS and a package manager (pnpm/npm) for local examples
- Docker Desktop or an equivalent container runtime
- A personal cloud sandbox (free tier) or local k8s (kind/minikube) if you plan to explore platform topics

## Self‑check (2 minutes)

- Can you explain the difference between throughput and latency at a high level?
- Do you know where to add a timeout and a retry in a client/server call?
- Can you sketch a very simple C4 Context diagram of a product you know?

## Takeaway

**Concepts in this handbook are interconnected.** No topic stands alone. Use these cross-references to:

1. Find **prerequisites** before diving deep into a topic
2. Explore **complementary views** of a concept from different angles
3. **Jump directly** to problems and follow a curated path to solutions
4. See how your current focus **connects** to the rest of architecture

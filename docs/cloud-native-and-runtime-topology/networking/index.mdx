## Overview

Networking bridges compute resources, services, and external users. Modern cloud-native networking must balance performance, security, and operational simplicity.

### Core Domains

1. **Load Balancing** – Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) and Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) traffic distribution, health checks, and session persistence.

2. **Network Policies & mTLS** – Encrypting service-to-service communication, certificate management, and zero-trust network access.

3. **CDN & Edge** – Content delivery networks, edge computing, and geographic distribution for latency reduction.

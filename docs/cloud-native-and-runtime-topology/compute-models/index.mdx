## Overview

Modern cloud-native systems offer three primary compute models, each optimizing different dimensions of cost, isolation, scalability, and operational complexity. This section explores the architecture, trade-offs, and decision criteria for each.

### Models Covered

1. **Virtual Machines (VMs)** – Full OS isolation, high compatibility, longer startup; suited for legacy applications, strict isolation requirements, and mixed workloads.

2. **Containers** – Process-level isolation, fast startup, dense packing; the foundation of microservices and Kubernetes-native architectures.

3. **Serverless/FaaS** – Event-driven, auto-scaling, pay-per-execution; ideal for transactional workloads, event processors, and bursty compute.

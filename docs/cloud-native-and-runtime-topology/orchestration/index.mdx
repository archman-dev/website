## Overview

Orchestration bridges individual compute resources (VMs, containers) and distributed applications. It answers critical questions: Which machines run which workloads? How do services find and communicate with each other? How do systems scale and heal automatically?

### Core Domains

1. **Scheduling & Auto-Scaling** – Resource placement policies, bin packing, affinity rules, and dynamic scaling based on load.

2. **Service Discovery & Ingress/Egress** – DNS-based discovery, load-balanced ingress, traffic routing, and egress control.

3. **Stateful Workloads** – Persistent volumes, ordered startup, and unique identities for databases, caches, and distributed systems.

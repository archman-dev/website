## Overview

Beyond compute, orchestration, and networking, platform teams must manage artifacts, ensure supply-chain security, and control costs through governance.

### Core Domains

1. **Image & Artifact Management** – Registry strategies, versioning, scanning, and garbage collection.

2. **SBOM & Supply-Chain Signing** – Software bill of materials, code attestation, and secure artifact provenance.

3. **Cost Controls & Quotas** – Resource requests, limits, namespace policies, and cost monitoring.

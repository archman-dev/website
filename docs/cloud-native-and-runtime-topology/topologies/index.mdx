## Overview

Deployment topology determines availability, latency, and disaster recovery capabilities. This section explores patterns from single-region high-availability to multi-region active-active systems.

### Core Topologies

1. **Single-Region Multi-Zone** – Data center with multiple availability zones; high availability within one region.

2. **Multi-Region Active-Active vs Active-Passive** – Geographic redundancy with trade-offs in consistency, latency, and operational complexity.

3. **Disaster Recovery Patterns** – Backup, restore, RPO/RTO, and failover strategies for business continuity.
